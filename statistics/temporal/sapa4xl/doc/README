LOADING SAPA

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In your shell, make sure that SAPA is in your XLPATH:

shell> setenv XLPATH your-sapa-dir:${XLPATH}

or:

shell> setenv XLPATH your-sapa-dir

To load SAPA from XLisp, type:

Xlisp> (LOAD "sapa")

The file 'sapa.lsp' loads all other necessary files and makes the
package available to the user by executing (USE-PACKAGE :SAPA).

It is HIGHLY recommended to byte-compile the package before running it,
because the compilation increases the execution speed up to 10 times.
