I am in the process of switching this list over to use the majordomo
list management software. Hopefully this will go smoothly and I won't
need to send any more messages about it. It not, ...

The change should not affect current list members. It does affect how
you leave the list or join it. Here are the new instructions:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

All routine administrative requests (including subscriptions and
unsubscriptions) concerning this mailing list are handled by an
automated server.  Please read this message carefully to find the
information relevant to you.

SUBSCRIBING
===========

To subscribe to stat-lisp-news, send the following in the body (not
the subject line) of an email message to "Majordomo@stat.umn.edu":

	subscribe stat-lisp-news

This will subscribe the account from which you send the message to
the stat-lisp-news list.

If you wish to subscribe another address instead (such as a local
redistribution list), you can use a command of the form:

	subscribe stat-lisp-news other-address@your_site.your_net

UNSUBSCRIBING
=============

To unsubscribe from stat-lisp-news, send the following in the body (not
the subject line) of an email message to "Majordomo@stat.umn.edu":

	unsubscribe stat-lisp-news

This will unsubscribe the account from which you send the message.
If you are subscribed with some other address, you'll have to send
a command of the following form instead:

	unsubscribe stat-lisp-news other-address@your_site.your_net

If you don't know what address you are subscribed with, you can send
the following command to see who else is on the list (assuming that
information isn't designated "private" by the owner of the list):o

	who stat-lisp-news

If you want to search non-privte lists at this server, you can do that
by sending a command like:

	which string

This will return a list of all entries on all lists that contain "string".

HELP
====

To find out more about the automated server and the commands it
understands, send the following command to "Majordomo@stat.umn.edu":

I'm having trouble getting xlispstat installed on a Decstation 5200 
running Ultrix 4.4 and X11R5.  Wondered if anyone has seen this one, it 
might be a problem in the X11 libraries?

Thanks to all who responded to my inquiry about running xlispstat in
batch.  

Now, to get this project off the ground, can anybody point me to some
code to do MANOVA (I am not much of a statistician)?

Thanks,

Hi all,

Looks like XLispStat's regression-model-proto allows regression without 
the intercept, but doesn't redefine the R-squared to an uncentered one.
Here is a little example:

Computing the square of the pearson correlation coefficient gets:

So one would never expect an R-squared of 0.00000.

Well, SAS knows about this:

So as can be seen from the output, SAS redefines the R-squared.
It should be done like this:
Let M be the usual centering-matrix I - 1/n \iota \iota' , \iota is the
vector of ones. Let further be y^ the fits and e the residuals y-y^.
The usual variance decompostion y'y = y^' M y^ + e^'e^ only holds,
when there is an intercept in the equation.
If not, you'll have to use y'y = y^' y^ + e^'e^, without the centering
matrix. 
Then the uncentered R-squared is defined as 1 - e^'e / y'y.
See for example in [1], page 29.

Doing this formula in XlispStat by hand results in:
  > (def b (sum (* (/ x3 (sum (^ x3 2))) x1))) 
    ; little strange, but it is LS-estimate
  B
  > b
  0.8506823571205249
  > (def x1^ (* b x3))
  X1^
  > (def e (- x1 x1^))  
  E
  > (def R2 (- 1 (/ (sum (^ e 2)) (sum (^ x1 2)))))
  R2
  > r2
  0.9292180955773006

So this is exactly the result of SAS and is conform to theory.
In the XLispStat regression-model R-squared is wrong.

Neither in the lisp documentation nor in [2] I found something about
how to create the right regression-analysis for models without intercept.

Did I miss something ?

Hi Berhard et al.,

First, it seems like you have found a weakness in xlisp-stat's calculation
of r in the case of a no-intercept model.  (I am not sure about that; I am
no expert).

BUT may I point out that the no intercept model is completely silly for these
data?!

If you do a scatterplot of x1 (y axis) as a function of x3 (x axis) you will
see that there is a strong NEGATIVE correlation and that there is a LARGE
positive intercept.  The ordinary linear fit is:
y=14.696 -.4741 x; r=-.98809

If you plot your no-intercept fit line on these data you will see that there
is a miserable fit.  (In fact it seems that the "alternative definition" 
of r must be screwy--it seems to me that xlisp-stat's answer of 0 is more
sensible). I confirm your fitted slope in the no intercept model of .85068.
NOTE that this slope is the wrong sign compared to the actual slope of
the data points!!

To me this is a good example of what can go wrong if you don't follow the
EDA philosophy which xlisp-stat supports with its various plots.

Best wishes,
Bill Simpson

Hi all,

My last posting about this subject used, as Bill Simpson pointed out,
a very silly example. I'm sorry about that, but I dealt the whole day with
colllinearity diagnostics and after looking at very much regression outputs
I lost a little bit the eye for the whole stuff.

Here is a more reasonable example now: (Well, I hope so)
--------------------------------------------------------

> x
(0.02994 0.25656 0.11788 0.1842 0.43233 
 0.4886 0.19711 0.16788 0.33304 0.50809)
> y
(-0.2447   1.79348  0.47305  1.06725 1.79162 
  0.87857 -0.37403 -1.42984 -0.20444 2.28)

> (regression-model x y :intercept nil)

Least Squares Estimates:

Variable 0                 2.75081      (0.992655)

R Squared:                0.302241    
Sigma hat:                0.980817    
Number of cases:                10
Degrees of freedom:              9

#<Object: 1639624, prototype = REGRESSION-MODEL-PROTO>



And this is what SAS thinks about it:
-------------------------------------

Model: MODEL1
NOTE: No intercept in model. R-square is redefined.
Dependent Variable: Y

                           Analysis of Variance

                           Sum of         Mean
  Source          DF      Squares       Square      F Value       Prob>F

  Model            1      7.38755      7.38755        7.679       0.0217
  Error            9      8.65802      0.96200
  U Total         10     16.04557

      Root MSE       0.98082     R-square       0.4604
      Dep Mean       0.60310     Adj R-sq       0.4005
      C.V.         162.63032


So the XLispStat formula seems to be another than the SAS formula.

And the formula for uncentered R-square computed by hand in Xlispstat 
shows the same value for R-squared as in SAS:
  > (def y^ (*  2.75081 x))                        
  Y^
  > (def e (- y y^)) 
  E
  > (- 1 (/ (sum (^ e 2)) (sum (^ yy 2))))         
  0.4604130049448324

Even if the reasonability of R-squared may be questionable for itself
when dealing with non-intercept models, it would be nice to have 
comparable results for reasonable datasets. 

Or, is still anything wrong ? 

Is there any literature regarding reasonability of R-squared when the 
intercept  is omitted ?

Any help is appreciated, 

with best regards

-- Bernhard

BTW, usually I still prefer regression with intercept if there isn't any 
good reason to leave it away. I just found this by chance and didn't 
understand the difference. Unfortunatly my first example was  silly ;-)

Does anybody know how to change to prompt character ">"?  

I would really like to suppress it because I run xlispstat as a batch
job and I would like to parse the output a little bit more easily.

Thanks,

Hello,


I am trying to use dynamic loading under Win32 (for windows 3.1).
I ran into the following problem :

	1) I used foo.c (Tierney (1990, p.362)).
	2) I defined foo.def as suggested in the document
		"XLISP-STAT for Microsoft Windows 3.0 Version 2.1 Alpha 6"
	3) The foo.dll was created with Borland C++ (Ver. 4.0).
	4) Under Xlispstat, I obtained the following message


		> (setf foo-dll (load-dll "foo.dll"))
		10254
		> (call-cfun foo-dll "foo" 5 (float (iseq 1 5)) 0.0)
		Error: can't find function address - "foo"
		Happened in: #<Subr-CALL-CFUN: #85d6ce9c>
		> 

Does somebody has a solution for this problem.

Thank you.

I have set up a very minimal page for Lisp-Stat. It is available
through the Projects & Research entry on the School of Statistics home
page, http://stat.umn.edu, or directly as
http://stat.umn.edu/~luke/xls/xlsinfo/xlsinfo.html (this URL may
change as we reorganize things here). Let me know if you have

Hello,

I just installed Xlisp-Stat and read some introductory course on it. Actually I was looking for some software package that can handle time series, spatial analysis techniques and related stuff. 
At this moment we only have SAS available at this site. I know I can solve a lot of my problems with SAS/IML but in the past I have worked with S-plus which has some features I am realy attracted to. Now I hope I can find some of these features back in Xlisp-Stat.
But first I have some basic questions.
1. Are there allready programs available that can handle time series and spatial data (variograms, ARMA models, ...) and where can I find them?

2. What is the maximum size of data sets that can be handled with Xlisp-Stat?

3. Can I exchange data sets (raw) from SAS to Xlisp-Stat or visa versa?

I appreciate any information,

Regards,

Olivier

The new features include:
> New datasheet editor is available for entering and editing data.
> Data can be imported from text files.
> Transformation menu has been completed.
> Data manipulation features for matrix data have been expanded.
> Double-clicking data icons now opens their datasheets.
These new features are summarized below.

DATASHEET EDITOR:
A datasheet editor is now available. It allows you to edit existing data
and to enter new data. You no longer have to prepare datafiles using lisp
statements, although these previously described features are available.

The datasheet is accessed through the SHOW DATASHEET item of the DATA
menu, and the NEW DATA, OPEN DATA, and IMPORT DATA items of the FILE menu.
The BROWSE DATA item of the DATA menu also displays data in datasheet form
but does not allow editing.

The datasheet supports standard editing functions.  Click on a cell to
edit it.  Type the desired information.  Use the delete key to delete what
you have typed. Use the cursor, return or tab keys to move to another cell.

The left column of cells contains observation labels. The top row of cells
contains variable names.  These can be edited like any other cells and may
contain any information that you wish. The second row of cells contains
variable types: Numeric, Ordinal and Category. The remaining cells of the
datasheet contain the data. You can expand the datasheet (add rows,
columns or matrices) and control the width of columns and the number
of decimal places shown. You can redefine which variable is used to
label observations.

IMPORT DATA:
A new FILE menu item is available for importing multivariate data.  The
data being imported must be in a text (ascii) file.  The first line of the
file specifies the data for the first observation.  Succeeding lines
specify the data for succeeding observations, and must contain the same
number of data elements as are on the first line.  Data elements must be
separated by spaces.

WORKMAP:
Double-clicking a data icon opens the data to reveal the data's datasheet.
Double-clicking a model icon opens the model to reveal the model's report.
For MS-WINDOWS, you can now open a reduced (iconized) window from the icon.
You can also open the window from the WINDOWS menu as well as the COMMAND
window.

TRANSFORMATION MENU:
The transformation menu has been completed.  There are 30 transformations
now available, plus a user-defined menu item that gives access to additional
user-defined transformations.

MATRIX DATA:
Data manipulation features for Matrix Data have been completed.  You can
now subset matrix data by matrix or by row/column, and you can merge
separate matrix data objects into one.

OPEN DATA, LOAD DATA and IMPORT DATA:
These menu items now always open to the data folder in the Windows version.
To support this, the data folder has been restructed.

DATA and MODEL menus:
These menus have been modified so that menu items for data and model
object names are optionally appended to the end of the menus, rather than
always being appended.  The option is controlled by a new preference
feature. This takes care of a MS-WINDOWS problem with menus being too long
for the screen.

BUG LIST:
A BUG LIST menu item has been added to the COMMAND menu.  It lists known
bugs and tells you how to report unknown bugs that you discover.

PREFERENCES:
The initial startup PREFERENCES menu item has been expanded.

ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE:
SAVE MODEL and CREATE DATA menu items have been implemented.
VISUALIZE MODEL is still not completed.

CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSIS:
Now analyzes all active numeric data rather than all numeric data.

PRINCIPLE COMPONENTS:
The visualization has been slightly improved.

I am still very interested;
we almost only have Unix workstations (with lisp-stat (and MUCH more) installed)

Why is ViSta not for Unix (X11)?
I always thought that the underlying x-lisp-stat is completely portable
between the 3 platforms -- including the dynamic graphics, mouse buttons,..?
am I wrong?

 Hello,
 
 I installed Xlisp-Stat because there are some advanced tools available for time series analysis and spatial data analysis, and because of the flexibility of the system.
 I downloaded the SAPA-files, dt4ets and the times-files. 
 Does anyone have any documentation on these programs? 
 
 Regards,
 
 Olivier

In order to economize on disk space, and more importantly on time,
we will make the Xlisp-Stat code archive a proper WWW hierarchy,
where "other people's code" will come from "other people's machines"
as much as possible. ViSta is the first example. It sits physically
at UNC, which is where it should be, and which is where it is maintained
and upgraded.

There are some minor problems with this (such as the fact that my
server tries to execute lsp files, instead of downloading or
displaying them) but they can be solved rather easily.

Although this is not strictly relevant for the newsgroup here, I thought
it was convenient to add (mostly because of the Grow/Guile/Java developments
at GNU, Cygnus, and Sun) information on Scheme to my WWW pages. See
      
           http://www.stat.ucla.edu/develop/lisp/

Also see http://www.cygnus.com/~tiemann/grow/ on exciting guile-based

I happened to come accross a version of Tom Almy/David Betz the
Xlisp 2.1g manual and language definition in html (made with
webmaker). The appropriate link is used in
         http://www.stat.ucla.edu/develop/lisp/
The orginal files (on CERN) consist of about 100 pieces of html, and
they are not reachable by ftp, nor is the directory in which they
sit browsable. So I didnt copy them to our server.

Hello,

I am using XlispStat for analyzing time series. From the UCLA server I've downloaded some utilities: time and SAPA. However, the latter is developed for common-lisp and not for Xlisp-Stat which I am using. A lot of errors occur; some of them I already solved, but they keep comming.
Does someone has any experience with the SAPA package, or - in general - does someone have some more information on time series analysis using XlispStat.

Thanks,

Olivier

Hi everybody,

Did someone write an XLISP-STAT function for plotting bivariate histograms
(such as in Silverman's book on Density Estimation)? I tried Matlab 4.2c
mesh/surf functions but they seem to be buggy (lines that should be hidden
are visible in some views).

I am trying to understand how xlispstat handles tail-recursion.  In some 
cases, at least, it appears that the interpreter behaves in a properly 
tail-recusive manner (ie., occupying a constant memory space) with 
byte-compiled tail-recursive calls (an example is appended).  What rules, 
if any, determine whether the byte-compiler will translate tail-recursive 
calls into iterative processes?

Also, are there any functions available for monitoring the argument 
stack?  

Thanks

The interpreter is not tail-recusrive. Byte-compiled code is (at least
supposed to be) tail-recursive.

Not really. Not likely to be useful inthe long run anyway since the
may not be an argument stack as such in future releases.

Hope that helps.

This rambles a bit, but it is well-meant. It is sort of reaction
to Luke's "Future Developments" paper. I have been feeling somwwhat
uneasy about the future of Xlisp-Stat, but maybe I am just getting old,
and I merely think that things are moving so fast because I am moving
so slow. O well, some random thoughts.

The number of possible choices for interpreters (sometimes with
byte-compilers, sometimes with compilers which produce C) which are
integrated with portable graphics packages becomes larger and
larger. This creates problems, not for individuals, but for 
larger units (departments, disciplines). Of course I am not
talking about commercial products here. It is bad enough that
these are around.

First we had Xlisp-Stat. Common Lisp based systems such as Quail 
and Clasp were no competition, because of the bloatedness and
price of Common Lisp, and because of the non-portability of the
graphics. This is probably also why the gcl/mcl version of Lisp-Stat
is still sitting there without graphics. There was also Winterp,
which is non-portable because it only builds Motif.

Then there was Tcl/Tk, which produced an enormous number of special
purpose programs/scripts, but no statistics system (probably because
of the limitations of Tcl, see the Tcl war papers). But there was
also Stk, which integrated tk (generally considered to be a nice
graphics lib) with Scheme -- non-portable, though, or at least
non-ported.

And then there were MrEd, Guile/Grow, scsh, Rscheme -- all based on
syuitable enhanced scheme interpreters. MrEd exists for MSW, X11,
almost for Mac. Guile/Grow is web aware, integrated with both Tcl/Tk
and almost with Emacs, and it has a very nice interface to the Unix
OS. scsh is a scheme based shell, i.e. a scheme interpreter with
extensions that make it a convenient Unix shell as well. Rscheme
will have interfaces with the portable Vibrant library. Guile will
produce a version of TkWWW, the WWW browser, with Scheme support
build in. Scsh comes with a http server in Scheme. 

In order to keep Xlisp-Stat current, top-of-the-line, the best parts
of these other newer systems should be integrated as well. This
means, I think, that we need an xlisp-stat lib, so that ordinary
C programs can open Xlisp-Stat interpreters, and use Xlisp-Stat
as an extension language (similar to Elk, Guile, Tcl). We need better
interfaces to the OS, and in particular to the networking and the WWW.
There are some things missing in the graphics at the C level (which
is why the three main versions are not completely in sync -- a nuisance
for programmers). I think this can be nicely introduced in a modular
way at compile-time (do you want to compile a features into the
executable) and at run time using packages. But it is clearly impossible
for one person (who has many other things to do) to do all this, and
it is also undesirable to have various incompatible versions in C
floating around. I am not sure what the solution is, but there is a
problem. So far, we only had to convince S users that Xlisp-Stat was
better, at least for some purposes. Now, this may not be the most
interesting battle any more.

There are now ways of doing statistics on the Web, using forms. This
is still rather primitive, but Java looms large, and creates the 
possibility to do dynamic graphics in WWW browsers without having to
use cgi and clumsy helper applications. It seems to me that the new
model that many people are working with is the "empty box", i.e.
each computer is a terminal on the net. This is related to the hype
which makes Marc Andreessen the new Bill Gates, but I do think it means
that networking and communications features should be emphasized
over traditional Lispish concerns such as prefix/infix (Dylan is in
limbo) and the object system. Communications is meant here as with the
OS, with other machines (if there is such a thing as other machines)
and with data (i.e. I/O).

Cygnus has 4 programmers working on Guile and comp.lang.java has more
than 200 posts/day (comp.lang.lisp.x has maybe 10/week).

On alternative freeware stats systems...

I thought I would mention R, a freeware clone of S.  Avail at:

Hi, 


Here is my question. I would like to display a boxplot, generate a new 
set of data, clear current boxplot, display new data's boxplot in the 
same boxplot window.

I have tried sending the existing boxplot window variations of :clear and 
:add-points messages, but nothing works so far.  Any suggestions?  

Regards,

See

http://monty.cnri.reston.va.us/grail-0.2/

for a browser with Python applets and access to Tk.

See

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/consult/computing.html

for some ways to compute with HTML forms (not as elegant as applets,
but better than using helpers).

I think this indicates the direction in which Xlisp-Stat should
move.

Jan --

I'm working on a WINTERP-based (aka extensible) WYSIWYG WWW
browser/editor for Unix (WWWeasel II).  To be released real soon now
(???). See http://www.eit.com/software/wwweasel for info on the old 
prototype (which sucks hideously as a WYSIWYG editor, but does pretty
well for other things, such as fulfulling the government contract that
funded it's development, acting as a structure-oriented media
composition tool, and giving us a platform to experiment with issues 
and needs involved with group document management and revision control.

Potential, future work for WWWeasel II will be in "smartening" creation
of tables and forms including back-ends for receiving/processing the
form data. I have found it helpful to have a real, high-level,
symbol-and-list manipulating language like XLISP/WINTERP to be very
helpful for such work...

PS: w/r/t your note's mention of WINTERP -- since when is Motif not
portable -- after all, it's *THE* *STANDARD* Unix GUI toolkit. Oh, you
mean it's not "multiplatform" -- yes that's true to the extent that
Motif isn't multiplatform. However, I have heard reports that WINTERP
1.XX was ported to VMS (since Motif runs on VMS). I have also heard
rumors of an NT port of Motif as well... Also, another aspect of
portability is internationalization, and Motif (IMHO) wins in that
regard.... not sure how Tk has progressed in that regard, last time I
looked at it, it appeared sub-optimal as a language to interface to
anything other than a string-based language like TCL;
internationalizaiton looked sketchy and simplistic.

I'm using the graph-window-proto to make gray scale plots.
Basically, within a nested set of loops I repeatedly send
a paint-rect message with different levels of gray to draw
the plot.

This works fine except that the plot doesn't automatically redraw
when uncovered.  I gather I need to write my own redraw method.
That's fine and is described in Tierney's book.  The problem is
that drawing the plot takes a while.  12 seconds or so on a 
pentium, much longer on my students' machines.  So I'd like to
avoid redrawing the thing from scratch every time.

I made a quick attempt at double buffering but this seems to
conflict with the other plots already on the screen.  This 
issue is mentioned in the book, but I was wondering if it 
might now be possible to use more than one buffer.

So is it true that I must accept the time penalty and redraw
the thing from scratch every time it's uncovered or is there
a better/faster way of doing this?

Jan:
Again I applaud and share your vision for improving the world with 
xlispstat.  We have begun using form-based xlispstat computing over the 
net in our classes.  A good example is located at:

http://seamonkey.ed.asu.edu/~behrens/rci.html

The page that xlispstat writes is Netscape 2.0 enhanced (sub and 
superscripts).  We have a couple other pages but they need a little 
cleaning.  We hope to complete a full set for an intro class and basic
 effect size meta-analysis work over Christmas holidays.  
Glad to know you will be doing power analysis.

I think this will dramatically reduce the amount of hand 
computation I do on the white-board for demonstration.  In addition the 
students are loving it not only because it does the computation, but we 
spell out the steps.  This will allow them to check their own work.  I 
anticipate it will therefore promote practice and reduce grading.  I can 
tell them to keep doing practice problems until they can match the 
computer.  As usual, it seems our biggest limitation (besides time) is 
our imagination.

We are doing something similar---I'll be post details later.

The main limitation here is that students don't have access to the
Web. However, we are setting up a new Linux lab with xlisp-stat as the
main statistical computing environment and things will be better then.

If you are using X11, you might consider the Hamlet approach -- it is an 
application which allows for dumping source code directly into a running 
program (xterm running xlispstat, xterm running splus, or xmaple; the 
latter is the usual platform, and it's nice for learning maple...). 

I've been working up some stuff for mupad(? forgot the name -- it's been 
a few weeks) and xlispstat.  I can't recall the link to it, but it's on 
my homepage at South Carolina. 

The big advantage is that you can keep dumping source code into the 
_same_ running program.

The big disadvantage is that it doesn't run without Motif or X (I've got 
access to a powermac lab, for my undergrads, so I'd prefer a solution for 
that other than just the long "download and load into xlispstat" 
paradigm).

That's the link to the Hamlet homepage, not the stuff I'm developing.  
It'll be available soon enough, though...

You need to be a little careful here. Forms-based approaches and
applet/helper approaches are very different -- forms-based runs on the
server, applets or helpers run on the client. They have different
advantages and problems (in particular different security problems).

I'm not sure why you make a big deal of the difference between applets
and helpers -- aside from some minor one-time setup issues for running
helpers, the only real difference a user sees is that applets run in
the browser window while helpers run in thier own window. Even this
distinction will go away soon. Netscape 2.0 is supporting PlugIn's
(http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_2.0/plugins/index.html)
which provide a protocol for having applications embed themselves in
the browser. At this point this is just another wonderful/annoying
(depending on your attitude to netscape) nonstandard netscape feature,
but given the OLE/OpenDoc wave on the desktop it is probably ging to
be standardized in some form. It is also a better way to go in the
long run: instead of needing a browser that understands python for
python applets, one that understands java for java applets, ..., you
only need one that understands a basic embedding protocol.

I would like xlispstat to work well in this kind of framework. There
are certainly too many variations of things one might do for any one
person to do them, and even if they did, new possibilites would come
up that were not anticipated. So the challenge is to figure out a
system structure that makes it easier for others to adapt the system
to these kinds of needs. The current system is reasonably extensible
within itself but is not suited very well as a tool for extending
other systems, for adding functionality to other systems. My long term
objective is to redesign the system to make it more flexible in this
respect. In the process it should become much more modular, and this
will make it easier to allow maintenance of parts of the system to be
taken over by others. This is all very wooly at this point --
hopefully it will become more concrete in the next few months.

In the meantime, hamlet (http://www.cs.utah.edu/~hamlet/) looks pretty
useful on the UNIX end. Writing something similar for Mac or Windows
using AppleEvents or DDE/OLE should be farily easy (getting commands
into xlispstat can be done now; simulating user typing can be done on
the mac but might need a little work on Windows).

For what it is worth, another interesting article on using the net to
help with instruction is http://thejournal.com/october/10andriole.html.

If you are using mac's, you currently have to use .lsp as the
extension. Also, you can only download each file once per session, at
least with netscape. The reason is that xlisp requires a .lsp
extension for files loaded in response to an ODoc Apple Event, which
is how Netscape sends files to its helpers. When you download a file
fred.lsp the first time as a helper data file, netscape brings it down
as fred.lsp. The second time it comes down as fred.lsp-1234 or some
such, which fails to work. There mey be some way to tell Netscape to
overwrite the previous fred.lsp, but I don't know how. I hope to
release a new mac version that fixes this (and several other bugs) in
a month or so.

I don;t know how things work on Windows. If anyone has tried using
xlispstat as a windows web helper application, i would like to hear
how it went.

In regards to:  making xlispstat more easily extensible, you might take a look
at http://betz.biostr.washington.edu/slisp/ to see what they have done with 
xlisp, in order to accomplish this very goal.

Regards for xlispstat: a user-friendly and useful package.

Does anyone know if (and where) I can find xlispstat binaries for Linux? I've 
looked in what I thought were the obvious places for lisp-stat and Linux 
software without any luck.

Thanks,

In March, I wrote an article on Xlisp-Stat for the August 1995 issue
of Linux Journal. (If you want a copy, I can make it available). At
that time, I made a binary, which is still available from
 ftp://euler.bd.psu.edu/pub/lj.

Note that with new versions of stuff being released for Linux so
frequently, it is possible that your versions of shared libraries
might be different from mine. So if you get a warning, just plonk the
correct version in from sunsite.

Subject: memory usage
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk

Does anyone know how to tell what a reasonable "expand" value is for the
(expand value) function? And, how big a memory partition one should use?

I would like to be able to do this automatically when ViSta first starts
up, because it seems that ViSta doesn't run too well without using expand.
I've also determined that if expand is too big, relative to memory size,
then ViSta totally dies at some point.

So far, what I've done, on the Mac, is set the maximum memory size to some
value (I've used 6, 7, 8, and 10Meg) and tried arbitrary "expand" values,
including (expand 50), (expand 100) and (expand 150).  Then I look at
"About this Macintosh" and make a judgment about how the memory bar-graph
looks.  If the dark part of it is about 3/4's across, I find everything
seems to work. If it takes up the whole bar, then ViSta certainly crashes
soon.

But I don't understand what's happening.

And I don't have a clue about what happens under Windows and Unix. Will an
expand value good for the Mac be good for other environments?

Can anyone help?

Dear Colleagues,

I have trouble in calling c functions on Windows 3.1

I have the following message:

> (setf foo-dll (load-dll"c:\\borlandc\\bin\\foo.dll"))
>4678
> (call-cfun foo-dll "_FOO" 5 (float (iseq 1 5)) 0.0)
> Error: Can't find function address - "_FOO"

I tried various combinations of the second parameter of call-cfun such as
"_foo", "FOO_", etc.


I will appreciate to have the solution on the above problem.

Thanks.

Huh, Moon Yul

Non-central distributions

I am a new (and very impressed) user of XLISPSTAT (MS Windows version).
A facility which would be useful to me would be the ability to obtain
the quantile (given the probability) and the probability (given the quantile)
for the non-central chi-squared (and t and F) distributions.

Has anyone developed these ? ...... thanks ... Bob Kinley

XLISPSTAT on SunOS 5.5 (Solaris 2.4)

Flushed with the success of the Windows version, I downloaded the Unix
version, only to find that I can't compile it (my fault, not Xlispstat's).
Could it be because the version on the net is for Solaris 4, while my machine
is on Solaris 5 ?          If so, has anyone else experienced (and solved)
this problem ??
                  Thanks .....    Bob Kinley

Well, it is easy to compile the sources under LinuX. XlispStat is very
well usable under LinuX in combination with Emacs. The only thing you
have to do is to change the sources to make dynamic loading
possible. If you are interested, I can send you the necessary
modifications. I have send them to Luke Tierney, but he refused to
include tthem in the official sources for XLispStat. It Compiles very
well under LinuX.

Subject: Compiler bug.

Xlispstat bug:

The compile function seems to lose environments.  For example,
consider the following code:

(defun make-add-n-fcn (n)
  (lambda (x) (+ x n)))
(setf (symbol-function 'add-10) (make-add-n-fcn 10))
(add-10 3)
(add-10 7)
(compile 'add-10)
(add-10 3)

This code makes a function add-10 which adds 10 to its argument.
After compiling add-10, however, it no longer works.  Here's the
xlispstat session:

> (defun make-add-n-fcn (n)
  (lambda (x) (+ x n)))
MAKE-ADD-N-FCN
> (setf (symbol-function 'add-10) (make-add-n-fcn 10))
#<Closure: #938fb8>
> (add-10 3)
13
> (add-10 7)
17
> (compile 'add-10)
ADD-10
> (add-10 3)
Error: The variable N is unbound.
Happened in: #<Subr-TOP-LEVEL-LOOP: #cf898>
> 

It looks like the compile lost the environment of the function.  It
seems to have treated the function like a lambda expression at top
level instead of like a closure.

According to the Common Lisp standard the behavior of compile is
"undefined" if the surrouning environment of a function being compiled
contains lexical variable or function bindings. Currently compile just
ignores such bindings. It would be better if it at least generated an
error message -- I will make sure it does in the next
release. Eventually I may arrange for closures with non-null
environments to be compiled, but it isn't often useful.

In this case you can achieve what you want by compiling 
make-add-n-fcn:

> (defun make-add-n-fcn (n)
    #'(lambda (x) (+ x n)))
MAKE-ADD-N-FCN
> (make-add-n-fcn 3)
#<Closure: #40064120>
> (compile 'make-add-n-fcn)
MAKE-ADD-N-FCN
> (make-add-n-fcn 3)
#<Byte-Code-Closure: #4006dfd0>
> (funcall * 2)

As far as I know, the Normal Distribution is the first
probability distribution with its own homepage

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/textbook/form-based/cdf/normal/

The computations on the page are done by forms and CGI
programs in C on our server.

The dynamic demo is done on the client machine. For this
you need to have Xlisp-Stat installed. But you needed that
anyway.

At Naras suggestion I installed a version of Xlisp-Stat which has
both system and popen disabled. I feel much better now.

Hi

I retrieved the documents, but i do not have a mc to print them.

Subject: Future direction desires...
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk


The discussion of future directions for xlispstat has spurred me into
thinking about what I'd like to see from it.  So, here's my
wish list...

1. Documentation.

The biggest problem I have with using xlispstat is incomplete
documentation.  I have the lisp-stat book, the xlisp reference manual,
and CLTL2.  But, these three documents are far from enough.  One
problem is that the lisp-stat book is not up to date - some things are
done differently than the book explains.  Even the online
documentation is out of date.  The other problem is that the basic
objects and their usage aren't completely documented.  I often end up
grepping the C & lisp code in the distribution when trying to figure
out how to do something, or even just when trying to figure out what's
available.  For me, having good documentation for xlispstat is of
primary importance.

For example, 

> (help 'make-array)
MAKE-ARRAY                                                      [function-doc]
Args: (dimensions
       &key initial-element (initial-contents nil)
            (displaced-to nil))
Creates an array of the specified DIMENSIONS.  The default for INITIAL-
ELEMENT depends on ELEMENT-TYPE.
NIL

It mentions element-type, but doesn't say what it may be, or how to
specify it.  I only found out by digging through cltl2 & reading the
xlisp source code (the two don't completely agree).  Tom Almy's
xlisp-plus manual (version 2.1g) doesn't mention element-type.  As for
the blas routines, I couldn't find any documentation whatsoever.

Furthermore, many object messages are undocumented.

So, I guess a function & object reference manual would be a great
help.

Additionally, I'd like to see documentation combined with either
references and discussion.  Something like a reference manual which
goes down to the tutorial level.  Something which doesn't just say:

COOKS-DISTANCES
Message args: ()
Computes Cook's distances.

Being a beginner in statistical analysis, I'd like to at least see a
reference to some discussion of what this is and what it's good for.
Ideally, the documentation would include definitions and usage.  This
is a bit much to ask for, since it would make the documentation a
fairly complete statistics textbook.  Maybe just a reference manual
with afew statistics textbooks listed in the introduction as required
background reading would be sufficient.

On the other hand, this aspect can go pretty far - consider for
example an html statistics textbook with xlispstat as a helper
application.


2. Efficiency.

I'd like to see xlispstat become more memory efficient and faster.
For example, I had to upgrade my PC (a 486dx66 running Linux) from 16
megabytes to 32 megabytes to be able to do some of the computations I
was interested in.  Now, I can just barely do 15 variable regressions
with 22,000 data points.  One would expect this to require at least
8*16*20,000 = 2,560,000 bytes of memory, but my xlispstat binary grew
to 29 meg.  Just reading in 22,000 data points (8 variables) causes it
to swell from 2.5 meg to 12.6 meg.

I'm sure that some of this is my fault for reading in lists instead of
arrays.  But to read in an unboxed array, I'd still have to use
(make-array 22000 :element-type 'c-double :initial-contents '(...)),
so I'd still create a large amount of garbage.

I'd like xlispstat to be industrial-strength in its data handling &
numerical computations.  For this, it should get all of blas (and
maybe lapack), have a compiler (not just a byte compiler), and have a
foreign function interface (which hopefully wouldn't be needed often).
In other words, I'd like to see enhancements along the lines of the
article "Fast Floating-Point Processing in Common Lisp" by Fatemean,
Broughan, Willcock and Rettig.  I think it's close, that having a
fast free lisp is extremely important, and that being fast and memory
efficient is also important for statistics.

On the other hand, to what extent it *should* be fast and able to
handle large datasets depends on what audience xlispstat is intended
for.  Is it to be a teaching tool, a statistics research tool, or a
full fledged statistics package?  I'd like it to also function as a
numerical algorithms testbed.

As a teaching tool, the speed and ability to handle large datasets
isn't so necessary.  On the other hand, it'd be nice for students to
be able to animate distributions - for example, to draw a bivariate
normal pdf and watch it change as the correlation coefficient changes.
This is currently doable, but would look alot nicer if xlispstat was
faster.  Furthermore, it'd be nice if students could learn to use a
stat package that they can continue to use as professionals.

As a full fledged statistics package, it should be able to crunch data
in a big way.  I'm not a statistician, and I'm not familiar with other
statistics packages, so I don't know how many data points one
typically needs to handle.  But I have about 800,000 10 dimensional
data points.  I'm currently using various techniques to reduce the
amount of data before loading it into xlispstat, but it'd be nice to
be able to at least handle 100,000 data points.

Also, alot of the functions (regression, kernel smoothing, etc) seem
to create alot of garbage.  A re-write based on blas et al might
significantly speed up these functions as well as reduce the amount of
garbage produced (thus increasing the size of problems addressable).

At the very least, it'd be nice to have some documentation on how to
run xlispstat efficiently.  Under what conditions should I use arrays
instead of lists, what iteration functions are fastest, etc.

A profiling package would also help.


4. Objects or Functions?

The flexibility of the object system is hampered by the use of
functions.  For example, there's a function plot-function which is an
easy interface to the scatterplot-proto.  If I like a couple of extra
things in my scatterplots, I can only add methods to
scatterplot-proto.  I can't define a new object which inherets from
scatterplot-proto, because then I lose the use of these helper
functions.  Furthermore, any other code which uses the helper
functions would then not get my new functionality because the helper
functions instantiate copies of scatterplot-proto.  This means that if
I want to enhance the system, I can only enhance the standard objects,
I can't inherit from them.  If I inherit from them I also have to
modify or replace all the helper functions.

If I'm only adding new functionality, then this isn't such a problem.
I just define new methods.  The problematic situations are the ones
where one would like to add a feature to a given message - i.e. -
where one would override a message and use call-next-method to invoke
the parent's behavior.

This is maybe a minor point, but I do bump into it regularly.


3. Package documentation.

Analogous to point 1, but somewhat orthogonal is the sparse
documentation for the packages in the xlispstat ftp repository.  For
example, in the statistics/regression directory, there are 17
subdirectories.  Many have much code and no documentation whatsoever.

For example, .../regression/sir contains 2 subdirectories full of lisp
code.  There's not even a README file saying what to load first, how
to use the package, etc.  I don't understand how anyone can be
expected to get any use at all out of the code.  It's a large body of
lisp code, and one would have to read it all to figure out how to use
it.  Furthermore, one would have to read it without any idea of what
it does or what the top level interface is supposed to be.

Not that I want to single out this package in particular, or that I
want to complain that the author who's giving away this package for
free didn't do more work.  But having a source repository which is
full of such packages makes it very difficult to find useful packages
that are easy to use.  It would take weeks to go through the
regression directory trying to figure out what each package is
supposed to do & how to use it.  Having all this undocumented code
there makes the directory *less* valuable.

One possibility is to only accept packages which include a README
file containing a description of what they do and how to start them
up.

Another possibility is to split the repository into documented &
undocumented.

In any case, I think that a well maintained source repository is very
important.


Looking forward to fast numerical processing in xlispstat,

Jose Garcia and Jason Bond have improved the WWW interface, which now
read and writes on the same page (using Tom Christensen's open2.pl).

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/cgi-bin/Xlisp-Stat.cgi

Jose is working on uploading files from a library (server-side)
and from the client. Graphics and Help are next. At some point we
may have to restrict access, but of course the perl or C is always
available.

FYI

After the normal distribution 

      http://www.stat.ucla.edu/textbook/form-based/cdf/normal/

the correlation coefficient now also has its homepage (I guess
my psychometric origins are showing). This is

      http://www.stat.ucla.edu/textbook/correlation/ 

This shows the working format for the textbook. Discussion, if
possible by using quotations from the history of statistics.
Then some traditional material (formulas, computing). This will
include actual forms for doing the computations. Then interactive
demos, for which you need Xlisp-Stat, which you needed anyway.

I will include material written by others (with acknowledgements
and permissions, of course).

Because there are no limitations on space and creativity, and because
anything on the WWW is "under construction" anyway, I think the textbook
can in principle serve both undergraduate, graduate, and postdoc
purposes. Thus I hereby invite contributions which fit in the framework
established so far. For the moment, I am the only reviewer.

This is still in early alpha. Inspired by stplan by Barry Brown et al
at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston (consists
of FORTRAN programs with a command line interface), reprogrammed in
Xlisp-Stat by Jason Bond, HTML and CGI in perl by Jason Bondand Jose Garcia.
You dont need Xlisp-Stat or perl for this, everything is run on
our server.

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~jbond/HTMLPOWER/newindex.html

Problems: the interface is barebones, the output from Xlisp-Stat
is copious (the answer you asked for is on the last line). Nevertheless,
it would be nice if some of you pounded on it, and reported
flaws to jbond@stat.ucla.edu

   I think times are ripe now for a new group -- something like, um, 
   alt.anti-xlisp-stat

This is fine. If you look at the list of alt newsgroups you will find
even weirder groups.

Remember, however, that for the bivariate normal, binomial, normal,
logistic, regression, and correlation calculators in the UCLA Statistics
Textbook project you do not need Xlisp-Stat. They are done in C on our
server. For the power calculator, you also dont need Xlisp-Stat. It is
run transparantly on our machine. For the dynamic demos you need to have
Xlisp-Stat installed on your Mac, Windows, or Unix web server, but only
as a helper. There is no need to learn a single line of Lisp.

In short, you get everything for free, even CPU cycles, and you dont
have to learn a single line of Lisp. All you need to be able to do
is click your mouse and type some numbers in a form.

It seems to me that it make sense IN THIS CONTEXT to subscribe to 
alt.anti-xlisp-stat, if you object to the fact that software is
free, that programs run unmodified on all kinds of machines,  and 
that source code is available without limitations by ftp or on request.
I agree these are serious disadvantages. I personally would much
prefer a black box, which does not run on Macs or FreeBSD or Linux, costs an
arm and a leg, and looks like a mainframe program with a facelift.

By the way, the UCLA Statistics WWW server now gets 8000 hits, more
than 3000 accesses, each day.

The CGI script has been improved

-- we are now getting rid of Xlisp-Stat orphans
-- we impose a max of 15 secs user time
-- we write the output to a scrollable window on the form
-- there is a button for a hypertext version of Tim Mikkelsen Xlisp
Reference
-- there is a button for a hypertext version of Tom Almy/David Betz

Subject: Tools for Modal dialogs
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk

Are there additional tools for modal dialogues that will prompt the user
for a number, edit the responses, and then only return when valid? It would
be similar to the edit-text-item-proto except you would pass it a number
type (integer, real, etc) and a valid range and it would ensure that the
users input is valid and within range.

At the moment, I'm using the edit-text-item-proto and then converting the
string to numbers using a read, but is there an easier way?

Thanks.

Code that would help can be found in my utilities package which is
part of an (as yet) incomplete literate program. I will distribute the
utilities toolbox at some point. The code is completely visible at
http://euler.bd.psu.edu/~naras/bpois.ps.

Subject: New Release of ViSta
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk

Announcing a New Macintosh Version of
ViSta - The Visual Statistics System
Version 4.21, December 17th, 1995
Copyright (c) 1991-95 by Forrest W. Young

This release of ViSta adds Univariate Analysis and fixes bugs in the
Macintosh and Power Macintosh versions.

If you are using earlier releases of ViSta on an Apple Macintosh or
PowerMac, I strongly recommend you obtain this new release, which is much
more robust.

This release is for Macintoshes only. The Windows version, which does not
suffer from the problems in preceeding Macintosh versions, will be updated
soon.

======================================================================
Changes since the previous publically announced release (4.12)
======================================================================

1) A new Univariate Analysis module is included, which does t- or Z-tests
(and confidence intervals) for one sample, two paired samples or two
independent samples, and does Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxen tests in
appropriate cases. The visualization is not yet available.

2) Changes have been made so that opened data icons reveal an uneditable
datasheet for browsing.  This datasheet may be edited with the new "Edit
Datasheet" menu item (which may also be used to open data icons to an
editable datasheet). As part of this change, the "Show-Datasheet" item has
been changed to "Edit Datasheet"; "Open Data" now does a "Browse Data"
rather than a "Show Datasheet" after the data are loaded; and
double-clicking a data icon does a "Browse Data" rather than a "Show
Datasheet".

3) The File and Analysis menus and the WorkMap's toolbar have been revised
in preparation for Univariate Analysis and for other modules under
development.

======================================================================
Bugs addressed since the previous publically announced release (4.12)
======================================================================

1) A bug was fixed which, on the Macintosh, sometimes caused a fatal error
when quitting ViSta with many open windows. This bug did not effect ViSta's
computations, since it occured after the decision to quit, but it could
completely freeze up the hardware, requiring a restart.

2) A bug was fixed which, on the Macintosh, sometimes prevented the workmap
from being redrawn after closing dialog boxes.  This was a fatal,
non-reproducible bug which prevented data analysis from proceeding. This
bug was fixed in release 4.20, which has been available for a few weeks but
was not announced.

3) Errors due to insufficient memory are difficult to deal with,
particularly on the Macintosh, where they may cause the system to die. If
insufficient memory is allocated ViSta simply "disappears". A memory
warning dialog has been added that suggests the ammount of memory that may
be needed. The warning appears after ViSta exits inappropriately.

4) Bugs have been removed from "Create Data".

3) A bug has been removed which caused errors when converting table data to
multivariate class data.

======================================================================
Availability
======================================================================

The complete code for ViSta, including documentation, test data, examples,
help, guidance, and the XLisp-Stat base, is available from our WWW and FTP
servers.

WWW: http://forrest.psych.unc.edu
FTP from www.psych.unc.edu, directory pub/forrest/vista.



======================================================================
The remainder of this message summarizes earlier messages about ViSta.
======================================================================



=======================================
What is ViSta?
=======================================

ViSta, is a Visual Statistics system that is
> open
> extensible
> freely redistributable

PLATFORMS: ViSta is available for
> Microsoft Windows 3.1
> Macintosh and PowerMac microcomputers
> A Unix version is in preparation

AUDIENCE: ViSta is useful for
> UNDERGRADUATES: Teaching introductory statistics to undergraduates
> GRADUATES: Teaching dynamic statistical graphics and computational
>statistics to graduate students
> RESEARCHERS: Research and development in dynamic statistical graphics and
>in computational statistics

ViSta is designed for an audience of users having a very wide range of data
analysis sophistication, ranging from novice to expert. ViSta provides
seamlessly integrated data analysis environments specifically tailored to
the user's level of expertise. Guidance is available for students and
novices, and tools are available for teachers and other experts to create
guidance for these novices. A structured graphical user interface is
available for competent users, and a command line interface is available
for sophisticated users. The complete Lisp-Stat (Tierney, 1990) programming
environment is available to researchers, programmers and graduate students
who wish to extend ViSta's capabilities.

=======================================
ViSta's main features
=======================================

> WORKMAPS
Maps that visualize the overall structure of an on-going data analysis
session.  These maps are created by ViSta as the data analysis session
progresses.  They aid novice and competent analysts in remembering their
analysis session, and permit the analyst to return to earlier steps of the
analysis.
> GUIDEMAPS
Maps that visually guide students and other novice data analysts through
their data analysis sessions.  These maps are created by experts using
ViSta's Authoring tools.
> SPREADPLOTS
Multi-window dynamic statistical graphics that visualize data structure and
analysis results
> MODEL RE-VISION
Dynamic interactive graphical tools that permit the user to visually
re-estimate model parameters
> ViDAL
ViSta's Data Analysis Language. ViDAL is an extension of the underlying
Lisp-Stat language that can be used by sophisticated data analysts for data
analysis and by programmers to enhance ViSta's capabilities.
> DATASHEET
A graphical datasheet for displaying and editing data.
> AUTHORING TOOLS
Visual tools for authoring new GuideMaps.

=======================================
Data Analysis Capabilities
=======================================

ViSta's data analysis capabilities include:
> DYNAMIC GRAPHICS
Histograms, Boxplots, Diamond Plots, Dotplots, Scatterplots, Biplots,
Spinplots, Scatterplot Matrices. Plots support brushing and labeling, and
are dynamically linked.
> DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
Means, Standard Deviations, Variances, Ranges, Quartiles, Medians,
Correlations, Covariances, Distances
>UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS
T- and Z-tests and confidence intervals for single sample, paired samples
and two independent samples data, with Wilcoxon Signed-Rank and
Mann-Whitney tests in appropriate situations.
> ANOVA
Univariate analysis of variance of orthogonal one- or multi-way data. Model
may or may not include two-way interactions.  The model visualization is a
spreadplot comprised of boxplot, diamond plot, quantile plot,
quantile-quantile plot and effects plot.
> REGRESSION
Simple and multiple OLS regression analysis (multivariate, robust and
monotonic regression in preparation). The model visualization is a
spreadplot comprised of a biplot, spinplot, histogram and
scatterplot-matrix.
> PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS
Analysis of correlations or covariances. The model visualization is a
spreadplot comprised of a biplot, spin-plot, scree-plot and
scatterplot-matrix.
> MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING
Analysis of one or more symmetric or asymmetric matrices. The model
visualization is a spreadplot comprised of a scatterplot, spin-plot,
scree-plot and scatterplot-matrix.  The spreadplot supports graphical
re-estimation of model parameters.
> CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSIS
Analysis of two-way contingency tables. The model visualization is a
spreadplot comprised of a biplot, spinplot, residuals plot and scree-plot.
The spreadplot supports graphical re-estimation of model parameters.

=======================================
Hardware Requirements
=======================================

MACINTOSH:
There are two versions of ViSta for the Macintosh, one for the PowerMac and
one for 680xx Macintoshes.  For 680xx Macs, we recommend a 68040 processor
(at the minimum, a 68030 + 68881 math coprocessor). Both versions require
System 7 or later, 3 MB of free hard disk space and at least 6 MB of RAM (8
for the PowerMac).   We recommend at least a 17", 8-bit (256 color) screen
(14" minimum). For 12-bit or 24-bit screens, a larger memory partition is
required (add 1/2 MB for 12-bit, 1 MB for 24-bit).

WINDOWS:
The Windows version of ViSta is for MS-Windows 3.1 with the 32-bit
extension. Users report that this version of ViSta also works under Windows
95, though no testing has been done. This version requires 3 MB of free
hard disk space and 8 MB of RAM. We recommend at least a 17", 8-bit (256
color) screen (14" minimum). For 12-bit or 24-bit screens, more memory is
required (about 1/2 MB for 12-bit, 1 MB for 24-bit).

=======================================
ViSta is a work-in-progress
=======================================

ViSta is a work-in-progress.  Some features are incomplete. While quality
assurance testing has been done, this is a beta-release system that is not
fully mature.

At the current stage of development, ViSta is viable as a supplemental
statistical software system used for extra credit exercises in introductory
statistics, and as the focus of graduate courses on research in
computational and graphical methods in statistics.  It may be premature to
use ViSta in undergraduate statistics classes that need a complete and
robust statistic analysis system.

Currently, the Delete Data, Delete Model and Simulate Data menu items are
not implemented; the ANOVA visualization is incomplete; the univariate
analysis visualization is not available; MULREG does not do multivariate
tests (it does many separate multiple regressions); transformations are not
available with matrix data; model interpretation is unimplemented; and the
Help and GuideMap systems are incomplete.

A univariate multiple regression module (which complements the current
multivariate multiple regression module with more extensive visualizations
and with the choice of robust or monotonic regression) is being written but
is not yet available.

=======================================
Documentation
=======================================

The following two monographs describe how to use ViSta:

Subject: Interprogram communication on Macs with AppleScript and Alpha
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk

I just wanted to throw this out for discussion. I am working on a project.
CLIPS is ideal for its rule based production systems and Xlispstat is a
truly wonderful statistical and mathematical workhorse.

The text editor Alpha, Xlispstat, and a variant of CLIPS (see the third
conference proceedings) all support AppleScript to some degree. None
support AppleScript as intently as they might, but that doesn't matter.

CLIPS is similar, enough in sytax to LISP so that one editor environment
could support both adequately. Since Alpha supports AppleScript and is
programable (in tcl shell) it can send expressions to the programs to be
evaluated and store the results as tcl variable.

I would just like to know that ideas of others on how to do this. It seems
that a way of defining objects independent of the systems that generate
them, like open-doc or ole, might be better. Yet AppleScript seems to be a
very viable way of doing things - though not really standardized in any
sense for CLIPS. AppleScipt's DoScript command, as long as the value is
returned and as long as at least on application (for my purposes Alpha) is
capable of sending the messages and receiving the return value should be
sufficient for have a truly multiprogram architecture for invoking and
using external programs as tools for an expert system.

I'm just going to keep plugging away and see what I wind up with, but I'd
love to hear any of the ideas of others. BTW, to see what an application
that actually supports AppleScript is like, take a look at MacPerl,
Netscape, or Excel.

The following things seem important to have in Xlisp-Stat, mostly
because of integration with the WWW.

(a) Xlisp-Stat as an extension language, i.e. a library that can be
linked into arbitrary applications (as in elk, guile, tcl), so that
one can open an Xlisp-Stat interpreter etc. This would be great,
because then we can put Xlisp-Stat interpreters in CGI applications.

(b) A safe version of Xlisp-Stat, in which no files and pipes can be
opened, and in which (system "") is disabled. This would be good
for our WWW interface to Xlisp-Stat, which now uses a kludge to
disable system and popen. See http://www.stat.ucla.edu/cgi-bin/Xlisp-Stat.cgi

(c) A version of Xlisp-Stat which supports pipe and fork and
exec and low-level IO. Good on general principles.

(d) A version or extension of Xlisp-Stat which writes gif files
on the fly to stdout (similar to the gnuplot stuff now build in
for character terminals) using Tom Boutell's libgd. This makes
it possible to write directly into browser windows.

I am interested in finding out if anyone has written any XLISP-STAT code for
Time Series, particularly Box-Jenkins ARIMA models.  
I have glanced at the contributed code labelled "Times" and "Sapaclisp" on
Statlib, but this looks like its more for spectral type analysis.
Thanks.

I doubt a bit that code is available
	((and I'll be too glad if I'm proven wrong!)).

	This is my experience:
Time-domain time-series analysis ``aka Box-Jenkins ..''
has been a domain where dozens of "different" packages have been sold to the
economics and econometrics community.
And I've not seen any free source code for it at all (lest some AR code
which is the trivial part of it). 

	The one thing you'll find in the  ApStat directory (of statlib) are
subroutines to compute the ARMA-likelihood, but you have to stuff it in
your own optimizer, and then this exact likelihood method is not the only
one you'd want. 

	The above situation is probably also the reason why S was week in this,
till S-plus added that part.
If anybody has someone (skilled) to program this (hopefully even in C) and
make it freely available, this would be a real good deed for the public..

BTW:
	A Happy New Year to you all !

Jose Garcia has translated his Perl CGI script to run Xlisp-Stat from
Web browsers to C. See

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~jose/Xlisp-Stat.cgi

and try to fancy help buttons !

I have made an interface to the Xlisp-Stat regression routines, also
in C, which is in

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/cgi-bin/textbook/regres-comp.cgi

This will get a bunch of buttons to put in the Xlisp-Stat optional
arguments. I still have to integrate the graphics in some way, and
then GLM will be next. Of course we'll put in file upload as well.
I'll try to keep the netscapisms to a minimum.

Announcing a New Release of
ViSta - The Visual Statistics System
Version 4.22, January 8th, 1996
Copyright (c) 1991-96 by Forrest W. Young

======================================================================
Summary of this release
======================================================================

All Versions:
> ViSta now includes a new Univariate Analysis module
> Data Icons are now opened in an improved manner
> Bugs have been removed from "Create Data"

MS-WINDOWS:
> ViSta is now available for the 16-bit version of MS Windows 3.1
> ViSta now incorporates Luke Tierney's Configuration code
> This release fixes some minor window management bugs

MACINTOSH: If you are using releases prior to 4.21 on a Macintosh or
PowerMac, I strongly recommend you obtain this new release, which is much
more robust due to fixes of two major bugs.

WEB SITE: The ViSta Web Site (http://forrest.psych.unc.edu) has been
expanded to provide much more complete information about ViSta's
capabilities.

======================================================================
Changes in releases 4.21 and 4.22
======================================================================

1) A new Univariate Analysis module is included, which does t- or Z-tests
(and confidence intervals) for one sample, two paired samples or two
independent samples, and does Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxen tests in
appropriate cases. The visualization is not yet available.

2) Changes have been made so that opened data icons reveal a datasheet
which may be browsed. It may be edited with the new "Edit Datasheet" menu
item (which may also be used to open data icons directly to an editable
datasheet). As part of this change, the "Show-Datasheet" item has been
changed to "Edit Datasheet"; "Open Data" now does a "Browse Data" rather
than a "Show Datasheet" after the data are loaded; and double-clicking a
data icon does a "Browse Data" rather than a "Show Datasheet".

3) The File and Analysis menus and the WorkMap's toolbar have been revised
in preparation for Univariate Analysis and for other modules under
development.

4) Luke Tierney's MS-Windows configuration code has been incorporated. The
first time that ViSta is run a ViSta/XLS program group is created for the
program manager. In addition screen font type and size are set, removing
the problem that some users had with screen fonts that were inappropriate
for ViSta's windows.

5) Import Data has been enhanced to import data with variables that have
string values as well as symbol and number values.

======================================================================
Bugs fixed in releases 4.21 and 4.22
======================================================================

1) A bug was fixed which, on the Macintosh, sometimes caused a fatal error
when quitting ViSta with many open windows. This bug did not effect ViSta's
computations, since it occured after the decision to quit, but it could
completely freeze up the hardware, requiring a restart. (Fixed in 4.21).

2) A bug was fixed which, on the Macintosh, sometimes prevented the workmap
from being redrawn after closing dialog boxes.  This was a fatal,
non-reproducible bug which prevented data analysis from proceeding. (Fixed
in 4.20).

3) Errors due to insufficient memory are difficult to deal with,
particularly on the Macintosh, where they may cause the system to die. If
insufficient memory is allocated ViSta simply "disappears". A memory
warning dialog has been added that suggests the ammount of memory that may
be needed. The warning appears after ViSta exits inappropriately. (Fixed in
4.21).

4) Bugs have been removed from "Create Data". (Fixed in 4.21).

5) A bug has been removed which caused errors when converting table data to
multivariate class data. (Fixed in 4.21).

6) Several minor bugs in the size, location and closing of spreadplot
windows in the Windows version have been eliminated. (Fixed in 4.22).

======================================================================
Availability
======================================================================

Complete information about ViSta, including code, documentation, test data,
examples, help, guidance, and the XLisp-Stat base, is available from these
WWW and FTP servers:
WWW: http://forrest.psych.unc.edu
FTP from www.psych.unc.edu, directory pub/forrest/vista.


======================================================================
The remainder of this message summarizes earlier messages about ViSta.
======================================================================


=======================================
What is ViSta?
=======================================

ViSta, is a Visual Statistics system that
> Performs univariate and multivariate statistical data analysis and
>visualization
> Provides visual maps for summarizing and guiding analysis sessions
> Includes a data analysis language and a programming language
> Is open, extensible, and freely redistributable

PLATFORMS: ViSta is available for
> Microsoft Windows 3.1 (Windows 95 in preperation)
> Macintosh and PowerMac microcomputers
> A Unix version is in preparation

AUDIENCE: ViSta is useful for
> UNDERGRADUATES: Teaching introductory statistics to undergraduates
> GRADUATES: Teaching dynamic statistical graphics and computational
>statistics to graduate students
> RESEARCHERS: Research and development in dynamic statistical graphics and
>in computational statistics

ViSta is designed for an audience of users having a very wide range of data
analysis sophistication, ranging from novice to expert. ViSta provides
seamlessly integrated data analysis environments specifically tailored to
the user's level of expertise. Visual guidance is available for students
and novices, and graphical tools are available for teachers and other
experts to create guidance for these novices. A structured graphical user
interface is available for competent users, and a command line interface is
available for sophisticated users. The complete Lisp-Stat (Tierney, 1990)
programming environment is available to researchers, programmers and
graduate students who wish to extend ViSta's capabilities.

ViSta is "freely redistributable". This means that it is not in the public
domain, but that it may be freely copied and redistributed, with certain
restrictions.  See the COPYING and COPYVSTA files included in the
distribution for details.

=======================================
ViSta's main features
=======================================

> WORKMAPS
Maps that visualize the overall structure of an on-going data analysis
session.  These maps are created by ViSta as the data analysis session
progresses.  They aid novice and competent analysts in remembering their
analysis session, and permit the analyst to return to earlier steps of the
analysis.
> GUIDEMAPS
Maps that visually guide students and other novice data analysts through
their data analysis sessions.  These maps are created by experts using
ViSta's Authoring tools.
> SPREADPLOTS
Multi-window dynamic statistical graphics that visualize data structure and
analysis results
> MODEL RE-VISION
Dynamic interactive graphical tools that permit the user to visually
re-estimate model parameters
> ViDAL
ViSta's Data Analysis Language. ViDAL is an extension of the underlying
Lisp-Stat language that can be used by sophisticated data analysts for data
analysis and by programmers to enhance ViSta's capabilities.
> DATASHEET
A graphical datasheet for displaying and editing data.
> AUTHORING TOOLS
Visual tools for authoring new GuideMaps.

=======================================
Data Analysis Capabilities
=======================================

ViSta's data analysis capabilities include:
> DYNAMIC GRAPHICS
Histograms, Boxplots, Diamond Plots, Dotplots, Scatterplots, Biplots,
Spinplots, Scatterplot Matrices. Plots support brushing and labeling, and

=======================================
Hardware Requirements
=======================================

MACINTOSH:
There are two versions of ViSta for the Macintosh, one for the PowerMac and
one for 680xx Macintoshes.  For 680xx Macs, we recommend a 68040 processor
(at the minimum, a 68030 + 68881 math coprocessor). Both versions require
System 7 or later, 3 MB of free hard disk space and at least 6 MB of RAM (8
for the PowerMac).

WINDOWS:
There are two versions of ViSta available for Microsoft Windows 3.1, one
for WIndows 3.1 with the WIN32S 32-bit extension, and one without. Both
require 3 MB of free hard disk space and 8 MB of RAM.  The Windows 95
version is in preparation. Versions for Windows NT and OS/2 are not
contemplated.  If you wish, you can try the 32-bit version of ViSta with 95
or NT or the 16-bit version with OS/2.  While I have not tried ViSta under
these operating systems, some people report positive results.  Let me know
your experience.

MONITORS:
We recommend at least a 14", 8-bit (256 color) screen, but 17" is
preferred. For 12-, 24- or 32-bit screens, a larger memory partition is
required (add 1/2 MB for 12-bit, 1 MB for 24- or 32-bit).

=======================================
ViSta is a work-in-progress
=======================================

ViSta is a work-in-progress.  Some features are incomplete. While quality
assurance testing has been done, this is a beta-release system that is not
fully mature.

At the current stage of development, ViSta is viable as a supplemental
statistical software system used for extra credit exercises in introductory
statistics, and as the focus of graduate courses on research in
computational and graphical methods in statistics.  It may be premature to
use ViSta in undergraduate statistics classes that need a complete and
robust statistic analysis system.

Currently, the Delete Data, Delete Model and Simulate Data menu items are
not implemented; the ANOVA visualization is incomplete; the univariate
analysis visualization is not available; MULREG does not do multivariate
tests (it does many separate multiple regressions); transformations are not
available with matrix data; model interpretation is unimplemented; and the
Help and GuideMap systems are incomplete.

A univariate multiple regression module (which complements the current
multivariate multiple regression module with more extensive visualizations
and with the choice of robust or monotonic regression) is being written but
is not yet available.

=======================================
Documentation
=======================================

The following two monographs describe how to use ViSta:

There is a xlsx.h header file with the Mac xlisp-stat distribution.
Are there any instructions on how to add an external function ? 


What I need in particular is a function to return a list of filenames
in a directory. I have not been able to find a way of doing this from
lisp - the common lisp function 'directory' is missing. Is there some
other way to do this ?

Subject: getting at the clipboard on the Macintosh
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk

        I have been experimenting with using the AppleEvents support in
Xlispstat for the Macintosh as a way to embed SQL in lisp code and using
FoxPro Mac as a quasi SQL-server.  FoxPro only supports the "dosc" (do
script) AppleEvent and does not return values through the AppleEvent
mechanism. So at the moment, whenever I need a value from FoxPro I have to
have FoxPro write it to a file and read the file in Xlispstat.  FoxPro has
a built in variable _CLIPTEXT which is always the value of the clipboard.
Xlispstat (on the Macintosh). [ In theory I could also write an
AppleScript, have Xlispstat send a do script message to FoxPro to run the
Script and have the Script send data to Xlispstat - but as I fear I'm very
near the abyss of total programming weirdness I thought it best to try to
avoid invoking another language (AppleScript) ]

        Xlispstat, supports methods to access the clipboard in the
window-proto objects.  So, far I haven't figured out how to access them
directly. As far as I can tell they are simply supported by menu-items in
objects created by the edit-window-proto prototype. Yet, it seems that I
should be able to access the data once I have a window-proto object using
the :paste-from-clip method. So far I haven't been able to do it. Perhaps,
I'm barking up the wrong tree and wasting my time.

        Is there thorough documentation on the methods associated with the
various windowing object? If I were to use an edit-window or display-window
could I get at the clipboard through those objects? Should I perhaps
actually be using menu objects instead?

Although there are a number of entries for namelist in the Lisp-Stat
book, these all point to about 3 inches of not very helpful text. 

The documentation for the FUNCTION 'namelist' is sufficient, but I 
can't find much on name-list-proto OBJECTS, their methods, and how
to subclass them. 

Searching the the lisp sources I find: 

  A couple of lines in graph2.lsp that set defaults in the name-list-proto
template. The namelist methods must be implemented in C -- searching
thru those sources, it looks like they are part of the idraw package. 
( I've had luck deciphering some of the other C sources, but the 
stuff in idraw remains pretty opaque to me, so I stopped there. ) 

 An example of their use in the function 'labels' in dotplot.lsp,
which was enough to help me figure out how to write a subclass
of name-list-proto. ( at the end of this message -- not very clean
perhaps -- I'm just trying to figure it out. ) This does pretty
close to what I want: it highlights the name in the list with the
same color that it uses to redraw that line in the graph.

Some problems: 

 Sometimes it takes two clicks on an item to get the color right -
 it will initially be highlighted in the previous color.

 It initially draws in black & white.

 Everthing sometimes disappears when the window is obscured and the
 uncovered -- i.e. contents are not redrawn. ( I tried adding a
 redraw method, but didn't quite work the way I had hoped, and it
 seemed to slow things down too much. )  

 
Is there any other documentation on name-list-proto methods ? 
Anyone have any tips or examples on how to do this sort of thing
properly ? 


Thanks.

Well I figured out how to get the data from the clipboard to show up.
I can send the window in which the user (me) is interacting with XLISP-STAT
the :paste-from-clip message and use the method that way.

So if I use the cut/paste option, as below, I wind up sticking "(send
*listener* :paste-from-clip)", and when it's pasted it retrieves itself and
is displayed in the *listener* window.

> (send *listener* :paste-from-clip)
(send *listener* :paste-from-clip)NIL

Oddly, this appears to be a mere side-effect, and the value of the
clipboard escapes. Am I still missing something.

I did come up with a round about way to do this.

(defun read-clip ()
  "Args none: will return the value of the expression on the clipboard
   provided it contains a single expression acceptable to the read function
followed by a carriage return. The second argument to read
   is simply a flag(t the default value or nil) to indicate that an error
messages should
   be returned on eof. The function will
   hang (at best) if the expression on the clipboard is not terminated by
   a carriage return"
  (read t (send *listener* :paste-from-clip)))

I'm trying to find out what kind of constraints XLisp-Stat has
on the size of data sets it can work with.  Can anyone provide any
guidance?

In particular, I'd like to use it on some panel data sets with 5,000+
observations.  I would be running a Unix version.

Thanks for any assistance.

It all depends on how much memory your machine has.  The more memory
you have, the larger the problem you can work on.  I don't know of any
inherent built in limits.

As for how much memory different tasks require, I can easily do
nonlinear regressions with 2,000 2dim data points on a 16meg Linux
machine.  On a 32 meg machine I can easily (albet slowly because of
the complexity of the mean-function) do the same with 8,500 data points
- the xlispstat process gets up to a size of about 12 meg.  For 12,000
data points, the process grows to a size of about 17 meg, occasionally
hitting 18 meg, so this would already be past the limits for a 16 meg
machine.  On a Linux machine with 16 meg of ram, the limit on process
size before things become too slow due to swapping is probably around
14 meg, so for my particuar problem, this would probably be around
10,000 datapoints.

Also, this is without any effort made to be especially memory
efficient - I'm using lists, not unboxed arrays, lots of garbage is
being generated, etc.

Good luck,

ABOUT COMPSTAT
--------------
COMPSTAT is a forum for the interplay of Statistics and
Computer Science. This important international event will
take place under the auspices of the European Regional Section
(ERS) of the International Association for Statistical Computing
(IASC), a section of the International Statistical Institute (ISI).
It is organized by the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC)
and will be held in the new campus of UPC where all facilities
required by a conference of this size are available.

ABOUT BARCELONA

Barcelona is a metropolis which is fully equipped for hosting
conferences and conventions. A city with a pleasant climate and
a prime location. It has a history which goes back 2.000 years,
and is culturally rich and varied. It has its own culture which
has been constantly enriched by the different peoples who have
passed through, and has open, enterprising citizens. It is built
on a human scale. Its avenues are wide, its buildings not too tall
and its climate, almost all the year round, is springlike. The city's
attractions are basically cultural, commercial and recreational.
Barcelona's attractions extend to its immediate surroundings. Within
a radius of little more than one hundred kilometres the visitor may
choose between a wide variety of landscapes and activities.=20


-----------
ABOUT UPC
-----------
Though the Technical University of Catalunya is a relatively young
university, it has more than a century of educational traditions to
draw upon.

UPC origins are found in the Instituto Politecnico Superior, which
was founded in 1968, by the grouping together of the Technical Schools
of Barcelona, e.g the Superior Technical School of Architecture and the
Superior Technical School of Industrial Engineering both of which date
back to the 19th century.

In the year 1971, the Instituto Superior Politecnico was formed into
a University, with the given name of Universitat Politecnica de Barcelona;
this name was changed in 1984 to the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya
given its enlarged sphere of influence, taking in not just Barcelona but
the whole of Catalunya.

In the last years Catalunya and its capital Barcelona have themselves
been driven by strong economic and social changes, which has manifested
itself not only within the business and technical world of Catalunya but
also the culture itself. UPC has contributed actively in this process of
change.

Today UPC offers a wide range of degrees, 24 of a three year duration,
11 of a five year duration and 12 doctorates, there are many courses
available for students who wish to continue/specialise in their field
of study together with an extensive programme of collaboration with
both private and public organisations. =20

------------------------
THE SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMME
------------------------
The scientific programme of COMPSTAT'96 covers a wide range of aspects,
from user-experiences and evaluation of software through to the development
and implementation of new statistical ideas.
The programme is intended to appeal to anyone interested in statistics and
its computational issues, whether in universities, industrial companies,=20
research institutes or as software developers. Therefore COMPSTAT'96 has
accepted papers in all fields of statistics but belonging to one of the
three following categories:

C1- Statistical methods (preferable new ones) that  require a substantial
    use of computing.
C2- Computer environments, algorithms, tools and software useful in statist=
ics.
C3- Applications of computational statistics in areas of substantial intere=
st
    (environment, industry, health, education, etc).

Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk

I downloaded a paper by B. Narasimhan that made extensive use of noweb. I
was very impressed with the layout and presentation of the code. (As to the
quality of the content I'm clueless.) Enough so, that I thought I might try
to use noweb or at least Slatex with the idea of generating readable
documentation using LaTex (Textures).  Unfortunately, noweb, at least from
my casual examination seems very much a Unix tool - or at least not a Mac
tool.  Then I thought Slatex might work and I was unable to get it to run
successfully in Xlisp-stat on my Mac. I figure the problem with Slatex
might simply be the options I selected.

Has anyone managed to get either Slatex or noweb to work on a Macintosh. If
you have could you give me a few pointers: what changes I need to make in
the distribution(s) and what documentation beyond the standard
distributions would be most profitable for me to read, etc. etc. ...

Subject: Small bug in xlispstat
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk


There seems to be a small bug in xlispstat 2.1 Release 3.47 (Beta),
X11 version.

In X11graph.c, RGB color values gotten from X via the call to
XParseColor are converted to a real range by dividing by MULTIPLIER.
MULTIPLIER is defined to be 62535.  I believe this should be 65535
instead.

The problem can be demonstrated by calling parse-color from the interpreter:

   > (parse-color "white")
   (1.047973135044375 1.047973135044375 1.047973135044375)
   > (* 1.047973135044375 62535)
   65534.99999999999

The expression (parse-color "white") should return (1.0 1.0 1.0).
Multiplying the returned value by MULTIPLIER shows that the call to
XParseColor was returning rgb values of 65535, thus demonstrating that
MULTIPLIER should be 65535 instead of 62535.

This is confirmed by this section of the XCreateColormap man page:


   STRUCTURES
	  The XColor structure contains:

	  typedef struct {
	       unsigned long pixel;/* pixel value */
	       unsigned short red, green, blue;/* rgb values */
	       char flags;         /* DoRed, DoGreen, DoBlue */
	       char pad;
	  } XColor;

	  The red, green, and blue values are always in the range 0
	  to 65535 inclusive, independent of the number of bits
	  actually used in the display hardware.  The server scales
	  these values down to the range used by the hardware.
	  Black is represented by (0,0,0), and white is represented
	  by (65535,65535,65535).  In some functions, the flags mem-
	  ber controls which of the red, green, and blue members is
	  used and can be the inclusive OR of zero or more of DoRed,
	  DoGreen, and DoBlue.

So far, the updated documentation has been saved only as bin-hexed,
self-extracting stuffit archives, a file format that is most appropriate
for downloading onto Macintoshes. The documentation will soon be saved in a
file format more appropriate for MS-Windows.

You can obtain the documentation in three ways:

1) World-Wide-Web
The documentation may be downloaded from the ViSta server at
http://forrest.psych.unc.edu/research/vista.html

2) FTP
You may ftp the same self-extracting-archives directly from
www.psych.unc.edu/pub/forrest/vista/mac. These archives are in files:
   * front.ps.sea.hqx
   * chapter1.ps.sea.hqx
   * chapter2.ps.sea.hqx
   * refernce.ps.sea.hqx

3) Mail
You may mail a US$5.00 check made payable to "UNC Psychometric Lab" to
Forrest Young at the address given in the signature of this message.

On XlispStat 2.1 R3.47 for Mac 
( I've seen the same behaviour with 3.43 / 3.44 ): 

Setting a plot's :back-color to any color not in the built-in set
assigned to *colors* does not work properly ( at least on Mac 
xlisp-stat ) Redefining *colors* to include the new color symbols
has no effect on this. 

Does anyone know why ? 

I ran into this limitation some time ago, but was able to avoid
bumping into it until now. ( I can probably still find a kludge
around it, but the bump on my head reminded me to ask about it! ;-)

Also, setting draw-mode to XOR for line-drawing doesn't seem to 
work right - I get strange artefacts around the fringe of the
lines. I was going to use XOR mode drawing to erase and redraw
a line using a different thickness when selected. Drawing a thicker
line when selected works fine, but I'ld like to replace the thick
line with a thinner one when its unselected. Any tips ? 

BTW: When moving development from Unix/X11 to Mac, I missed having
parse-color on the Mac, so I wrote something to parse an X11 "rgb.txt"
file into a "RGB.LSP" to give the Mac a parse-color and make the
same color names available.  Source is appended at bottom for 
anyone interested.

Announcing updated MS-Windows documentation for
ViSta, the Visual Statistics System.

The MS-Windows documentation has been updated to correspond with the
current release of ViSta (4.22) and with the earlier announced Macintosh
documentation. The documentation includes cover and contents, an
introductory chapter, a tutorial chapter, and references. The Windows
documentation exists as zipped postscript files. The Macintosh
documentation exists as self-extracting-archives of the same postscript
files. These postscript files must be printed on a postscript printer.

Adobe Acrobat pdf files will be available soon. These files can be read and
displayed by Acrobat Reader and then printed on a very wide variety of
printers, including non-postscript printers. Acrobat Reader is available
from Adobe at no cost from their site at
http://w1000.mv.us.adobe.com/Acrobat/Acrobat0.html. In addition, you can
download Amber, a free beta version of the next release of Acrobat Reader
from the same site. In addition to the capabilities of Acrobat Reader,
Amber can display the documentation within a NetScape Navigator 2 window.

You can obtain the documentation in three ways:

1) World-Wide-Web
The MS-Windows and Macintosh versions of the documentation may be
downloaded from the ViSta server at
http://forrest.psych.unc.edu/research/ViSta/doco.html

2) FTP
You may ftp the zipped postscript files for downloading and printing from
MS-Windows. The ftp site is:

Well - First I wrote a subclass of name-list-proto: It 
prints element names in the color that the elemental peaks
are plotted in on another graph. When you click on an element,
the appropriate plot is drawn with a thicker line ( and, if
you've used the menu to change the selection color, a new 
color ) and a marker. 

I rewrote the :isnew and :do-click methods to implement this 
class. 

PROBLEM: If a selection is make by some method other than clicking,
for example using the "Selection..." menu item, the do-click method
isn't called. Actually, my real need is to link the two windows
more symmetrically, so that a click in either window updates the 
state of the other. ( This differs from the standard Lisp-Stat
linked plots in that it is not respective points that are linked,
but points or items in a list are linked to overlays in the 
scatterplot. ) 


OK - so it seemed to make more sense to use the parents :do-click,
and instead to customize the selection method. There are three 
that seem appropriate:


POINTS-SELECTED
Method args: (&optional list)
Sets or Return indices of current selection.

SELECTION
Method args: (&optional list)
Sets or Return indices of current selection.

POINT-SELECTED
Method args: (point &optional selected)
Sets or returns selection status (true or NIL) of POINT. Sends 
:ADJUST-SCREEN message if states are set. Vectorized.


 Of those, :POINT-SELECTED looked like the most basic, as it is
able to select or unselect points. So - I re-wrote :point-selected.

Only problem is -- it doesn't appear to get called when I make
a selection. The item in the name list is highlited as selected,
but my method is never called. 


What is the actual flow of control of selections in graphics 
methods ? I can't figure this out.

To followup my own question: 

 I finally found the answer in the section on Linking in the 
LISP-STAT book.

 :adjust-points-in-rect and :adjust-screen-point appear to be the 
methods to catch changes in the point's state. ( I'm still not
sure of the exact flow of control -- i.e. whether these methods
are called whenever a points state changes via any method. )

NIL
 

 I can understand overlooking strings as not very useful as a form
of COMPOUND-DATA, but omitting them introduces an undesirable 
type inconsistency. 

 In a pure OO language, a type like COMPOUND-DATA would naturally
be usable anywhere another type of sequence would be used. I've
been successfully using the package at the bottom to rectify this
problem in Xlisp-Stat. It redefines #'LENGTH and #'ELT to work
on both regular Lisp sequences and COMPOUND-DATA sequences, however,
I finally got bitten by the above type inconsistency when I tried:

> ( length "a string" )
Error: not a compound data item - "a string"
Happened in: #<Subr-COMPOUND-DATA-LENGTH: #b694dc>

and found I had to use:

> ( xlisp::length "a string" )
8

because strings ARE sequences, but they AREN'T compound-data-sequences.

Can anyone point me to a good tutorial on how to use color in
Xlispstat graphics?  

I've been able to make a few simple colored plots, but I'm
finding that I need to do much more complex programming in order
to simplify the resulting visuals.  I'd appreciate anything ---
from a well-written, comprehensive, and indexed tutorial some
kludgy code "with only a few misleading comments" :-)

Thanks!

Peter

  I've found color, and particularly colored area plots quite
useful when the plots get "busy" - however, when the get so busy
that you really NEED color, you also probably need finer control
of the drawing sequence. 
  Drawing objects in overlays gives you control of the redraw 
sequence -- however, overlays, as designed in Xlisp-Stat, are
not intended to overlay the content area of the plot - the were
actually intended for controls rather than graphics overlays. 
  A Plot's :REDRAW method calls :REDRAW-BACKGROUND, :REDRAW-OVERLAYS
and then :REDRAW-CONTENT, in that order. However, the problem is
that :REDRAW-CONTENT clears the content area, so any overlays there
will be erased. I have some overlay classes, which along with a 
modification of the redraw order, will work. 
  However, I'm currently "between versions" : some of my recent 
queries to this list have been about how to link a name-list to
the overlays in the plot. ( I've almost got this figured out - 
things ain't quite how they are documented in the book! ) 

  What I'm doing with it is: 

 Plot an Xray Energy Spectrum with a colored area plot; 
 Fit the spectrum against a set of elemental reference peaks and
 draw the peaks scaled by the coeffecients in different color lines.
 Draw the residual background using a gray line. 
 Color the areas under the residual in two different continuum 
 measurement regions in another color.

 Clicking on a peak, or on the element name in the linked namelist,
causes that peak to be selected, which causes it to be redrawn with
a thicker line width, and some peak markers to be displayed. 

 That last paragraph is the part currently under construction: 
I've tested several unsatisfactory hacks that semi-worked, and 
I think I've finally figure out how to do it "right". I hope
to have that complete sometime this week -- I'll be happy to
post it when finished. ( Unoptimized, and doing a few more screen
:redraw's than absolutely necessary. )

Is there any way to get the RGB colors of the standard built-in
*colors* on Mac Xlisp-Stat ? 

I'm using the code at bottom along with the mac version of parse-color
I previosly posted. 

Parse color returns the "pure" values for the standard colors - 
e.g. ( parse-color 'red ) => ( 1.0 0.0 0.0 ), ( parse-color 'green ) =>
( 0.0 1.0 0.0 )

However, when I add:

  ( lighter-color 'green )          ; LIGHT-GREEN = ( 2.0 1.0 2.0 ) ]
  ( darker-color 'green )	    ; DARK-GREEN  = ( 0.0 0.8 0.0 ) ] 
  ( make-color 'real-green 0.0 1.0 0.0 )
 
And plot them along with the standard built-in color 'GREEN, 
the latter is by far the darkest of them all.

I haven't been able to find a function that returns the actual
RGB colors used ( and I can't just free and replace a standard 
color.)

There may have been a bug in the code I posted -- 
I think I dropped a mapcar that forced the range to ( 0.0 - 1.0 )
which was in an earlier edit. 

However, the problem was and still is as I described -- at least
with GREEN -- some other colors I have checked look correct. 

Better version of the code is below:
 Fixed the max,min problem to keep RGB values between 0 and 1.
 functions return: ( Values color-symbol rgb-value-list )  
 [ Since generated symbol names like |BLUE-complement| will 
   also not return a value from parse-color ] 


Sorry to be so quick to post before I've double checked everything,
but I'm seeing a severe delay in mail getting out to the list, 
which has made me quick on the trigger with these questions. 
The problem may be on our end rather than with the list -- UVA
has a *severly* overloaded central mail server.

I'd like to do some large nonlinear regressions.  Unfortunately, doing
this in a straight forward manner causes xlispstat to suck up memory
until it sends my machine into a swapping frenzy.  This is under Linux
on a Pentium 120 with 32mb of memory.

I have about N = 20,000 data points, each data point consisting of 3
parameters X and a response Y, and a P = 9 parameter model.  In other
words, I have a 9 parameter family of functions of R^3 to R, and I'd
like to choose the one which best fits my 20,000 data points.

I can just barely manage this on the above machine using nreg-model.

However, I'd like to add some annual seasonality, allowing for a shift
and a scaling that depends on the month of the year.  This adds 24
parameters to the function.  I'd also like to use larger data sets.

I tried just using nreg-model, but as I said, it sends my machine into
fits of swapping.  I killed xlispstat when it grew to about 36meg.

Since I'm only trying to minimize something like (Y-f(X))(Y-f(X))^t as
a function of the parameters, one should only need to work with a px1
jacobian matrix, where p is the number of parameters.

However, nreg-model computes the derivative of Y-f(X) as a function of
the parameters, thus yielding a Nxp matrix which it manipulates.  This
obviously takes much more space, in fact, too much to be handled on a
32 meg machine.

Currently, I'm planning on explicitly minimizing the above equation
using newtonmax, but then I lose all the nice statistics that
nreg-model gives me.

So, does anyone have any ways around this?  Perhaps an alternative
nreg model proto which relies on newtonmax instead of make-jacobian
and make-sweep-matrix?

In my last message, I asked about aternative nonlinear regression
code.  My problem was that nreg-model computes the jacobian of the
mean-function.  My mean-function takes 33 parameters, and returns a
vector of length 20,000.  This causes the function returned by
make-jacobian to suck up all available memory and go into a swapping
frenzy on my Linux box with 32meg of memory.

To avoid this, I tried using newtonmax as a replacement for
nreg-model.  I worked out how to get all the statistics I desired
without computing the above matrix directly.  However, it turns out
that this only trades my space problem for a time problem.

Newtonmax computes the Hessian of the function that it is maximizing.
In my case, this takes over 1000 function calls.  Each function call
takes about 5.5 seconds, which means this will take about 1.5 hours
per iteration!

I tried using nelmeadmax instead of newtonmax.  This has the advantage
of not computing the Hessian.  However, it doesn't seem to do a very
good job of finding the minimum even in the 9 parameter case.  It
keeps stopping with an "iteration limit exceeded" message.

So, my question is, does anyone have any other maximization or
nonlinear regression code for xlisp-stat?  Something that's both
conservative in space and number of function evaluations?  Perhaps a
gradient based maximizer which doesn't appeal to the Hessian?  Or,
does anyone have any ideas on other methods for doing this
computation?

  In my last message, I asked about aternative nonlinear regression
  code.  My problem was that nreg-model computes the jacobian of the
  mean-function.  My mean-function takes 33 parameters, and returns a
  vector of length 20,000.  This causes the function returned by

Have you tried applying all the usual efficiency tricks to your code?
If not, the problem may lie in your mean-function.  For the benefit of
those readers on the list without a whole lot of lisp experience, here
are some things to try:

1) Make sure you are using arrays not lists (for small data sets the
flexibility of lists outweighs their overhead).

2) Try to avoid "consing" functions which allocate new storage
automatically.  Things like append, push, mapcar, etc all generate new
storage.  Especially try and avoid things which generate and free
storage in the middle of a loop.  If you know the size of the
list/vector you need to generate, you can pre-allocate storage for it
outside the loop (using let) and then pass the scratch space as an
argument (ala BLAS code) or as a lexical closure, e.g.,

(let ((BIG-SCRATCH (array 20000)))

  (defun my-mean-fun (params)
	(dotimes (i 20000)
	   (setf (elt BIG-SCRATCH i) (...))
	...)
    ...)
)

This insures that

2a) I'm not sure if the vectorized functions of Lisp-Stat fall into
this category.  I seem to recall that early versions of ISP had
problems with the storage for intermediate results seemed to cause a
problem.  I'm not sure how the vectorization works in Lisp-stat, but I
recall it is the naive implementation (i.e., it just applies a mapping
function and generates an intermediate event).  This works fine for
problems which don't demand to much in the way of resources but is
really inefficent in more complex circumstances (i.e., operations on
vectors of length 20,000).

You may need to rewrite them as you would in Fortran or C, i.e.,
specifically allocate intermediate storage and write explicit loops
which do the operations.  

You might also need to do that inside the nreg-model functions. (One
big advantage of XLISP-STAT is that it is an open implementation.  If
you need to re-implement part of the system because it doesn't work
for your project you can do it.  It more than makes up for the fact
that not all of the implementations are "clean."

Good luck.  If you need more tricks, I would refer you to any number
of elementary texts on Lisp.  I actually am quite fond of Peter
Norvig's book on AI programming in Lisp.

I input all the data as typed-vectors (type c-double).  My
mean-function does produce garbage, but not 30meg of it.  Although the
excessive garbage creation could be slowing things down, I verified
that it's not filling things up - I forced a gc in my mean-function,
and xlispstat still slowly grew to 40meg.

Regarding the use of vectorized functions.  I had always believed that
although they produce alot of garbage (by virtue of the fact that
they're returning the results), they're quite fast.  I had thought
that avoiding them would probably make things too slow.

However, I just did afew preliminary tests, and I'm quite surprised to
see that this might not be the case.  Consider:

(I use type-of to avoid accumulating garbage in the history variables
*, **, etc.)

Note that (* m m) seems to stabilize at about .36 seconds, and spends
over 1/3 of its time in gc, whereas the corresponding non-garbage
producing vect-prod function ends up taking .32 seconds.  So, it seems
that byte-compiled vector operations can actually end up being faster
than the built in vectorized operations.  This is quite a surprise for
me.  Presumably, if there were a way to use the unvectorized scalar
multiplication function in vect-prod, then vect-prod could be further
speeded up.

In any case, in my setting, the problem with nreg-model seems to stem
primarily from make-jacobian.  One call to the function it returns
causes a 20meg increase in the size of the xlispstat process.  And
this is with my modified make-jacobian which uses one-sided
derivatives so as to half the number of function calls.

Now that I see that explicit array accesses can be as fast as
vectorized operations, I'll try rewriting my mean-function (as well as
make-jacobian, and possibly parts of nreg-model) and see what
happens...

It may be that * is written very generically and is basically doing what
your version is doing.  So there is probably a  optimization
opportunity here.

Looks like the GC could use a bit more tuning for these situations --
I'll think about that.

I'd be a bit careful about jumping to conclusions here. The byte code
compiler does reduce the penalty of doing lisp-level looping, but
vectorized arithmetic in principle has far greater potential if it
properly takes into account the type of the data. Typed vectors have
been added only recently, and while they work with the vectorized
arithmetic, the type information is ignored -- that is why the result
comes back as type 'VECTOR. Eventually I will change this so that *
applied to two typed floating point arrays will return a typed
floating point array and be implemented internally as a tight C loop.
(There are still a few issues I'm not sure about yet, like what should
happen when log is applied to a typed floating point vector containing
1.0 and -1.0 -- should the result be a generic vector containing a
float and a complex, or a typed complex vector? Similar issues need to
be thought through for integer overflow).

Another point to keep in mind is that speed isn't the only reason to
use vectorized arithmetic -- vectorized code is usually clearer and
hence easier to get right.

One of the things I am thinking about is modifying the compiler to
rewrite functions using vectorized arithmetic so they use as little
memory as possible and also do as much of the computation in native
data types (unboxed values or typed vectors) as possible. THis is
longer term sutff, so who knows when it will come to fruition.

I rewrote my vectorized mean-function to be iterative (and to return
the result in a supplied array so as to avoid gc).  The routine is now
over twice as fast as it used to be.  It used to take about 5.5
seconds to run, with about 1.5 seconds in gc.  Now it takes about 2.5
seconds to run, with no time in gc.

Also, timing (* m m) when m is a list instead of an array seems to
take somewhat longer.

Incidentally, I also rewrote make-jacobian to use an internal typed 2
dimensional work matrix instead of building up the jacobian each time.
Whereas calling the function returned by the stock make-jacobian would
cause xlispstat to swell by about 20meg, the new version initially
allocates 5meg and never grows any larger.  It seems like I'll be able
to use nreg-model again after afew more changes of a similar nature.

I agree that in principal the vectorized code should be faster.  But,
in the current implementation, it seems that there's alot of overhead
to the vectorized functions when the args are compound data types.
Even more so than explicitly using map!  As the following shows, it
seems that using mapcar to multiply to lists of floats is about 10%
faster than using the native multiplication!  (The times are much
longer here because they're being run on a 486dx66 instead of a
pentium 120 - I ran these tests on a different machine with a
different xlispstat binary to make sure that the surprising timing
results were *not* due to my having messed up the xlispstat binary.
None the less, I'd appreciate it if others could verify my results.)

So, although using the vectorized functions does typically lead to
much simpler and straight forward implementations, I'm afraid that the
current implementation extracts an efficiency cost for this.  Also,
it's difficult to recover the time in the current implementation,
because the unvectorized versions are unavailable at the interpreter
level.

As I mentioned above, I still find all this rather startling.  So, can
someone please verify some of these results?  Even better would be a
more complete study of what is fast and what isn't fast in xlispstat.

I managed to hack nreg-model to handle the problem I've been working
on (namely 20,000 data points, 33 parameter mean-function).  The key
savings was rewriting make-jacobian to build an output matrix when
it's called, and have the jacobian function always build up the
jacobian within this matrix (and return this matrix).  It's probably
clearer to look at the code, so here it is:

(defun make-jacobian-2 (f n m)
"Args: (f n m)
F is a function of an N-vector, and returns an M-vector. Returns a
function that approximates the jacobian function iof F by a one-sided
difference."
  (let* ((h .0000001)
	 (res (make-array (list m n) :element-type 'c-double))
         (del (* h (column-list (identity-matrix n))))
	 (fx0 (make-array m :element-type 'c-double))
	 (fx0+h ()))
    (lambda (b)
      (blas-dcopy n (funcall f b) 0 1 fx0 0 1)
      (dotimes (i n)
	(setq fx0+h (funcall f (+ b (nth i del))))
	(dotimes (j m)
	  (setf (aref res j i)
		(/ (- (aref fx0+h j)
		      (aref fx0 j))
		   h))))
      res)))

So, basically, after:

(setq j (make-jacobian-2 #'f 33 20000))

then 

(funcall j param-vector)

builds up the jacobian within the typed matrix res, and returns res.

There's still additional garbage being created, but it's quite minor
compared to the make-jacobian in nonlin.lsp.

I also subclassed nreg-model-proto to use the above make-jacobian-2,
and wrote a version of nreg-model to use the above modifications, and
for completeness, to take a mean-function which works in a supplied
work array instead of one which always returns a new mean vector.

In any case, after these two modifications, the xlispstat process only
grows to about 16meg when doing the nonlinear regression, thus
comfortably running on a 32meg machine.  There are other places which
could be modified for less garbage creation, but it's only of order
number-of-parameters^2 as opposed to number-of-parameters *
number-of-data-points, so it's not really needed.

OOPS! I spoke too soon.  I had it running while I was typing this.
During the minimization it was doing fine at 16meg.  But when it got
to the output phase, it started eating memory until it got to about
40meg (on my 32meg machine), and died with a segmentation fault!  So,
I guess I still have a little more work to do to keep the memory usage
down...

Incidentally, recoding the mean-function to use a work space and to be
iterative (as opposed to the original which used the vectorized
functions) speeded up the mean-function by a factor of 2!  I had always
assumed that the fastest code is produced by using the vectorized
functions, so I'm quite surprised to see that I've been paying a
significant speed penalty for using them.    I still
find this surprising, but it really indicates a need to investigate
just how fast the vectorized functions really are...

I guess it's not so surprising, given that it's built to handle things
like: 

   (* '((1 2 3) 4 (5 6)) '(7 (8 9 10) (11 12)))

Maybe the vectorization needs some fine tuning.  Perhaps some of the
tests could be moved up and out of the iteration.  Or, maybe common
subcases could be handled at the top...

Thanks to everyone for their help,

You're right.  When I upped the list size to 100000, * and mapcar seem
to be about the same...

However...

I just built a version of xlispstat with all the scalar operations
available at the interpreter (called scalar*, scalar+, ...).  I
find that (mapcar #'scalar* m m) does beat (* m m) by about 10% (when
m is initialized to be (normal-rand 100000)).

Here's the timings of the last 10 runs of each:

             (* m m)              (mapcar #'scalar* m m)
         time   gc    time-gc       time         gc       time-gc
Trial
  1    1.57    0.67   0.90          1.22        0.49       0.73
  2    1.35    0.45   0.90          1.23        0.49       0.74
  3    1.58    0.67   0.91          1.23        0.50       0.73
  4    1.35    0.45   0.90          1.22        0.49       0.73
  5    1.57    0.67   0.90          1.22        0.49       0.73
  6    1.35    0.45   0.90          1.22        0.49       0.73
  7    1.57    0.67   0.90          1.23        0.51       0.72
  8    1.36    0.45   0.91          1.22        0.49       0.73
  9    1.57    0.67   0.90          1.22        0.49       0.73
 10    1.38    0.45   0.93          1.22        0.49       0.73

Note that time - gc is very stable, and indicates that mapping scalar*
gives a sizable win (about a 20% savings in time) computationally over
just using *.  The alternating of the gc column for (* m m) indicates
that (.67+.45)/2 is a pretty accurate estimate of the average gc time
for (* m m), which comes out to .56, which is also significantly
higher than the average gc time for the mapcar version (which just
happens to be stable here).

I just wrote that (mapcar #'scalar* m m) is significantly faster than
(* m m).  But, before you all go out and recompile your xlispstat
binary to take advantage of this, note that scalar* will *not*
necessarily be faster than * for byte compiled code.

I just tested scalar* vs * using:

   (defun vect-prod (x y result)
     (dotimes (i (length x))
        (setf (aref result i) (* (aref x i) (aref y i)))))

vs

   (defun vect-prod2 (x y result)
     (dotimes (i (length x))
        (setf (aref result i) (scalar* (aref x i) (aref y i)))))


It turns out that vect-prod is marginally slower than vect-prod2 on a
c-double array of size 100000 (presumably because interpreter overhead
swamps the difference between * and scalar*).  However, after byte
compiling, vect-prod is *faster* than vect-prod2.  Out of 10 runs,
vect-prod takes 1.184 sec (standard dev = 0.0143), and vect-prod2
takes 1.629 sec (standard dev =  0.0100)!

I'd guess that the byte compiler has a byte code operand for *, and
that dispatching on a byte code operand is much faster than
dispatching to an arbitrary function.

If I get ambitious, I might look into the byte compiler to see if this
is the case, and if it is, maybe I'll try adding scalar* and see what
happens...

Also, in the same run, I tried out (* m m) again.  The last 10 runs
give an avg time of 1.12 sec (standard dev = 0.0115).  This time,
vect-prod is *not* beating (* m m), in fact, it's marginally slower.
As others have pointed out, my previous claim that a byte compiled
vect-prod can be faster than * is unjustified, in fact, the converse
seems to be supported (by a small percentage).

Note that timing (* v v), where v is set by (coerce m 'list), gives
the same results as in my previous message (avg time 1.465 sec).  So,
it should be noted that vectorized * is significantly faster on
c-double typed arrays than it is on lists.

If you insert (mapcar #'* m m) then this gives a result in between. On
my system:

> (time (progn (* m m) nil))
The evaluation took 1.83 seconds; 0.62 seconds in gc.
NIL
> (time (progn (mapcar #'* m m) nil))
The evaluation took 1.44 seconds; 0.42 seconds in gc.
NIL
> (time (progn (mapcar #'scalar* m m) nil))
The evaluation took 1.32 seconds; 0.47 seconds in gc.
NIL

The reason for the difference is most likely extra function calls --
things done with C functions, rather that macros or switches, to make
the code simpler. When * is called with scalar arguments, there are
two more C function calls than with scalar*. Similarly, when the
mapping is done in *, there are two more function calls per element
(accessing sequence elements) than in mapcar.

The difference wetween the vectorized arithmetic mapping and mapcar is
easy to eliminate, since it all comes down to one function, map in
compound.c. I'll rewrite that to eliminate the function calls.

The difference between * ans scalar* is a bit harder to deal with, but
I might be able to handle it with a macro. I'll loox into that. It
will result in increased code size (still a worry on Mac's and PC's)
but may be worth it.

That is exactly what happens.

The scalar versions of these sunctions will eventually be availale
once I get around to taking proper advantage of the package mechanism
by putting all the lisp-stat related stuff in its own package. Then
the scalar functions will be in package COMMON-LISP or CL (eg cl:*)
and the vectorized ones in package LISP-STAT or LS (so ls:*). There
are a lot of details I still need to work out about how to handle
putting things in packages, so this won't happen overnight, but will
happen eventually.

(For what it is worth, the main reason I added the package facility
was to be able to isolate the internals of the compiler -- this it
does quite nicely. Working through the rest of the code to take
advantage of the package system has lower priority.)

If I make an object with a 'hardware-address slot equal to Nil, the: 
  "Error: no slot by this name - HARDWARE-ADDRESS" 
error when linking to it and selecting points, changes to:
 "Error: No IView installed in this window"

If I set the hardware-address equal to the hardware-address of a
third plot, then the code generates no errors, but does not propagate
state to the linked objects. 

If I modify :adjust-screen-point to also check and reset the state,
then everything works as it should, until I close the dummy plot
whose hardware-address slot I have borrowed. The "No IView" error
then reappears. 

My guess is that state setting is the function that violates 
encapsulation here: point state is not set or read via the
:point-state or :last-point-state methods, but objects diddle
with each other's implementation specific internal-state. 

Further evidence is that no :POINT-STATE messages were traced 
until I added the explicit call in :ADJUST-SCREEN-POINT, and
when I "borrow" the HARDWARE-ADDRESS slot of the Green plot,
it does not, because it is not linked, get a call to :adjust-screen,
but if I send it either a :REDRAW, or a :NEEDS-ADJUSTING T and
a :ADJUST-SCREEN, the selection is updated to be identical to
the RED and BLUE plots. 


The test code at the bottom demonstrates the problem if you load
it, select some points, and the close the GREEN plot and select
or deselect points. 


Is there any way I can "fake out" IView's need for a 
HARDWARE-ADDRESS slot without actually having a dummy window on
the screen ?

Hello,
   
    I'm just now getting around to compiling 3.39 (I'm pretty sure that's 
the version.  I don't have it here) on my NeXTstation running NS3.2.  When 
I compiled the previous version 2.1R2(?) I had mouseX running and had all 
of the X11 libraries.  However, now I have Cub'X user version, i.e. no 
libraries.  Is there a way to compile this and draw X11 windows rather than 
gnuplot?
    Can I download the mouseX stuff and load those (X11R4) libraries or 
does it have to be X11R5 which is what Cub'X uses (I'm pretty sure)?

    Thank you for any info.

Chuck Kincaid

Sorry if this message was a little short on context.
This was a followup on two previous messages, both with
different subject lines, about my problems trying to link
points in a namelist plot with graphic overlay objects. 

Unfortunately, the current linking protocol seems to violate
object encapsulation: you can only link to an object with
an allocated HARDWARE-ADDRESS representing an allocated IDRAW
graphics window. [ Now that I've finally managed to rebuild 3.44
on the mac, if I don't hear any better suggestions, I may try
to modify the idraw sources to provide a "dummy" graphics object.]

Compiling Xlisp-Stat 3-44 on PPC Macintosh using CodeWarrior 8

[ Note: Success with 3.44, but I still haven't been able to build 3.47. 
  Question: Are there any instructions, examples or documentation 
   on how to build and use external function on the Mac ? ]

Source code changes:

[1] linalg.h::
  wrap #define abs with conditional #ifndef

#ifnedf abs
#define abs [...]
#endif 

[2] macstuff.c::
  The definition of struct PPCPortRec has changed slightly --
  Change the several occurances of:
	name.u.port.type	=>  name.u.port.portType
	name.u.port.creator	=>  name.u.port.portCreator 

[3] TransSkel1.c::
Changed "(long)" cast to "(long *)": 

# ifdef __CONDITIONALMACROS__
	InitDialogs ((long *) initParams->skelResumeProc);
# else
	InitDialogs (initParams->skelResumeProc);
# endif

(I have not investigated why this change - this was a guess
guided by the compiler complaints. ) 


Open and convert the old project file.

Project Preferences Changes:

add {Project f}:: to access paths.

Change Prefix File from "CWHeader" to "CWHeader.h" in
C/C++ Language prefs and Turn on MPW Pointer Type Rules 
option. ( This got rid of the first type complaint when
compiling TransSkel1.c -- the source mode above got rid
of the other. )

add console.stub.c & SIOUX.PPC.LIB to the project.


Make sure that you have checked the convert newlines 
option when untaring on the Mac, or else convert the
.lsp source code. If you don't, load of file will return
T, but you won't get the side effects of loading the file.
CW and ThinkC libraries seem to handle this differently. 


( load "cmpsys" ) generates a number of stack overflow
errors compiling some files. Increasing the stack size
from 32k to 96k and relinking did not fix this problem. 

Everything else I've tested so far seems to work fine.


3.47 does not build - the distribution is missing a file:
"rcondest.c".  Copying the rcondest.c file from the 3.44
distribution and compiling, generates a  page full of errors
that aren't generated in the 3.44 system compile. Now that
I have 3.44 successfully compiling I'll take another look
at the problem. ( Why is this file missing from 3.47 ? )

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Q: I am looking for code to save XLISP 'objects' as  a
recursive function that writes an ASCII representation
of a LISP object to a file.

Unfortunately  Mark Kantrowitz' SAVE_OBJ.CL requires Common-Lisp.

At the moment I am adapting his code. For example objects are
save through (derived from code from Luke Tierney's distribution):

(defun object-dump-form (object)
  (labels ((save-slot (slot) `(send m :slot-value ',slot ',(get-dump-form (send object :slot-value slot)))))
          (let* ((proto (send object :slot-value 'proto-name))
                 (islots (send object :slot-value 'instance-slots)))
                (append (list 'let (list (list 'm (list 'send proto  ':new))))
                                 (mapcar #'save-slot islots)
                                 (list 'm)))))

Conses are dumped through:

(defun CONS-DUMP-FORM (item)
  `(CONS ,(get-dump-form (first item))
         ,(get-dump-form (rest item))))

and so on. The function GET-DUMP-FORM calls the dump-form, that ist adequate 
to the type of the object.

Does anyone know of related work?

Thanks!

I'll send you some code i have, also in Common Lisp.  One issue when
dumping to to avoid consing up something that is as big as the thing you
are trying to dump.

I have two questions for the LispStat group:

1) First Question:
Have I discovered a bug or is there something wrong with the following code?

(dotimes (i n)
         (send self :label-strings
               (combine (send self :label-strings
                              (format nil "~a~d" "Obs" nobs+i)))))

This code is supposed to add strings such as "Obs3" "Obs4" "Obs5" to the
strings that already exist in the label-strings slot.  However, if, say,
n=14, nobs=1 and (send self :label-strings) returns ("Obs0") I get errors
such as

Error: index out of bounds - 1
Happened in: #<Subr-SELECT: #111cefc>

or

Error: index out of range - 1
Happened in: #<Subr-AREF: #10fe93c>

Furthermore, the number of times I can get through the loop before the
error occurs changes from time to time. Close examination shows that the
errors seem to be coming from the second (send self :label-strings). This
method is a simple slot-accessor method defined as follows:

(defmeth datasheet-proto :label-strings (&optional (list nil set))
"Message args: (&optional list)
 Sets or retrieves the list of label strings."
  (if set (setf (slot-value 'label-strings) list))
  (slot-value 'label-strings))

HELP!

2) Second Question:
If I replace the above code with

(send self :label-strings
      (combine (send self :label-strings) (repeat "Obs" n)))

I have no problem. However, this code creates the strings "Obs" "Obs" "Obs"
etc., where what I really want is "Obs1" "Obs2" "Obs3" etc. Can someone
suggest a way of doing this that is different than the way I tried above?

Its been pointed out to me that there is a variable "nobs+i" in my code
that doesn't make sense.  True...it was left over from my obsessively
changing code that was originally (+ nobs i).

Let me restate my problem, perhaps this time without the mistakes I made
last time. I've also incorporated a change suggested by Frederick Udina.

My Question: Have I discovered a bug or is there something wrong with the
my code?

What I want to do is to generate a list of strings with increasing integers
at their end and add them at the end of a list of strings that already
exists in a slot.

The slot is "label-strings".  So if I do:
(send self :label-strings)
I get something like:
("a" "b" "c")

Frederick noted that if I used:
> (mapcar #'(lambda (n)
              (concatenate 'string "Obs" (num-to-string n)))
          (iseq 5))
I would get:
("Obs0" "Obs1" "Obs2" "Obs3" "Obs4")
This is true.


Thus I write

(send self :label-strings
     (combine (send self :label-strings)
              (mapcar #'(lambda (i)
                    (concatenate 'string "Obs" (num-to-string (+ nobs i))))
                          (iseq n))))

where nobs=3 (the length of the list already in the slot) and n is the
number of new strings I want to add. If n were 5 I'd like to get

("a" "b" "c" "Obs0" "Obs1" "Obs2" "Obs3" "Obs4")

Sometimes I  do, sometimes I get errors. There errors are either

Error: index out of bounds - 1
Happened in: #<Subr-SELECT: #111cefc>

or

Error: index out of range - 1
Happened in: #<Subr-AREF: #10fe93c>

To repeat my question: Is this a bug or is there something wrong with the
my code?

I compiled some code that used the loop macros. The interpreted version ran
fine, though slowly. The compiled version would come up with an error -
variable "until" not defined.  I have two thoughts as to the cause.

(1) I have an actual error in the code but the clause that is triggering it
only occurs when the code is rearranged for optimization.

(2) I missed some trick to make sure that the supporting code for the loop
clause was known to the compiler.

 Now that I've managed to compile xlispstat-3.47 successfully,
I've figured out enough of the internals to provide one of my own
previous requests: A 'directory' function to return a list of
a directory's contents. ( Note: I've still been searching for
examples or documentation on how to write a dynamically loadable
code extension for xlisp on Mac. There's little explaination
in the xlsx.h header file except for a reference to "the New S
book". ) 
  This has only been tested on Mac ( using CW8 ), but the 
code ought to be portable to any system with dirent.h routines.
  See comments in the code for outstanding questions about Common
Lisp compliance.  I have paper copy of CLtL1 nearby, but I may
have to wait until Im back iin the office to check what CLtL2
says. Comments on my comments appreciated!


 You need to add "DIRECTORY" to the function table. 
 On my first attempt ( with the simple #'xyzzy ), I added some
extra entries to the table and got some strange behaviour.
( And no - I didn't drop the end-of-table marker. ) 
When I instead just modified some of the extra not-implemented
entries, it worked fine. Is the size of this table hardcoded 
somewhere ? Or is there anything else that would explain this.

Dear Luke, Steven and Frederic:

Thanks to each of you for your replies to my messages about the problems I
was having.  All of you agreed that my code looked innocent enough. I've
finally figured out what the problem was, and it's such a tricky situation
that I thought I'd share it with you (and with the group in general).

The problem wasn't the code, it was a timing problem. Note that I'm working
on Macintoshes and under Windows.

The code was a part of a method for the datasheet that I have written as
part of ViSta.  The datasheet is a graphical object that inherits from
graph-proto.  The method in question presented a dialog box which let the
user add rows or columns to an already existing datasheet.  When the dialog
box was closed the slots of the object were updated to reflect the
additional rows/columns and the window was redrawn using the updated
information and showing the additional rows/columns.

The problem was that there are TWO redraws involved:  The first one to take
care of the disappearance of the dialog box; the second one to take care of
the changes in the datasheet.  And SOMETIMES the first one would occur when
the object's slots were still in the process of being updated, so that they
contained inconsistent information.  When I realized this it was simple to
place the window in a "don't redraw" state until all slots were updated.

This actually is the second time I've run into this situation, the first
being for my workmap and it's dialog boxes.  That first time it literally
took me THREE MONTHS to catch this bug. After all, it was un-reproducible,
occured rarely, didn't occur on all machines (due to differences in speed)
nor with all displays (due to differences in relative locations of the
dialog box and window). It was clarly the worst debugging situation I've
had in my 5 years on this project.

At least I've learned from my previous mistakes - This time it only took me
a week to realize that I had the same type of bug all over again. Next time
let's hope I recognize the situation immediately.

Once again, thanks for your help.  I thought I was crazy there for a while.

This is a very good point. There is a very limited (and very ad hoc)
bit of multitasking that happens, in particular in the Mac and Windows
versions. This is needed to process window events related to switching
from one application to another, among others. As a result, a :redraw
can be triggered almost any time a window is visible. If you need to
prevent this, you need to arrange for your :redraw method to do
nothing in these inopportune calls and to be triggered once the data
is ready. Essentially, you have to invent a little semaphore mechanism
like Forrest did.  I tinker with this at the ends every so often to
try and minimize the effect but it is still there. The right solution
is probably to add support for preemptive threads, put the event
handling process in its own thread, and provide a synchronization
mechanism to deal with situations like this. This is in the works for
a future release (rather long term future at tis point).

Is there any way for an object to catch all messages, even and
especially those that are undefined for the object ? 

I've been writing my own linking mechanism that doesn't trigger
the implementation dependent graphics linking, and I have added
a :broadcast method: this allows the base class methods to be
implemented in terms of :broadcast, an only ( or mostly ) 
:broadcast has to be changed to alter parts of the linking behaviour.

 In debugging this code and in trying to figure out how to get
to my required behaviour, I first tried linking two plots using
my alternate linking mehanism ( it gives the same behaviour as 
the built-in linking, as it should ) and secondly, I tried linking
the plots thru an intermediate object, that just propagates the 
messages it gets to the others in the chain. 

 It would be useful for such an object to respond to all possible
messages, - perhaps just rebroadcasting them to others, perhaps
modifying the messages or arguments, or for debugging, maybe just
printing a trace message before rebroadcasting. 

  In my particular case, I want to transform a certain set of
messages into a different set -- the object becomes an adapter
for between two different interfaces/protocols -- but I would
like it to just pass on any other message ( perhaps first 
checking :has-method on the receiver. ) 

 From what I *THINK* I know about how ( send obj :msg args ) is translated
into a ( msg-closure obj args ), I don't see a good place to hook
into this, and if the :msg is not part of the args ( It isn't, is it? )
then even dynamically adding methods ( all dispatched to the same
re-send code ) wouldn't work. 

 This is not vital for my current project, but if it was possible,
it would allow me to write more general and reusable objects, and
would be a great debugging tool. ( Well - I guess for debugging,
you can globally just redefine #'send and get the same effect. )

Yipes!! This stuff has been dealt with effectively way back in the late
80's in this archaic piece of technology known as the X window system
and the X toolkit. Hasn't anybody built an abstraction to give a 
"nice" interface (perhaps w/ {X,Xt,<toolkit>}-like API) to events and
windows that is multiplatform?  

What are people's experiences in deploying xlisp-stat for
multi-platform applications -- do you have to do a lot of mucking about
at the  events level to make things work just right? And what about
WxWindows and Mr. Ed? When I do custom graphics apps with
WINTERP/Xtango (on Sun, Irix, Linux, & HP platforms), the ability for
multiple things to be going on at the same time is typically the least
of my worries.

  Is there any way for an object to catch all messages, even and
  especially those that are undefined for the object ? 


I did some similar stuff in ElToY.  I defined an :update message which
would pass a message along to all of its children objects.

Thus I would send (send <obj> :update <signal> <args>).

If <obj> had a method for <signal> it would execute it, then it would
send the update message to every "child" object.  The ubdate mechanism
was attached to a base class object (el-object) which every ElToY
object inherited from so it was more or less universal.

Another alternative would be to define a :before or :after method
which did the updating on the base class object for your system.  (As
xlisp doesn't support :before and :after methods, you will need to
fake this with call-next-method).  Then any message which must be
propagated would get defined with that update message attached to your
base object.

You might want to take a look at the ElToY code.  Unfortuantely, it
seems to have disappeared from the UW archives.  I'll post a new
version soon.  (Apparently ElToY exercises a bug in version 3.44 of
Xlispstat, I'm not sure whether to release a patched version with a
workaround or wait until Luke releases the next version of XLISPSTAT
with the bug fix).

I don't think it's that trivially solved in X. 

The folks working on Python have been running into a few similar
glitches trying to get ILU and Tk to work together in one image - 
they both expect to have their own main event loops, and that 
and the fact that they both make use of unix signals seem to cause
some strange interference.  

One of the goals of a higher level toolkit like Tk or the graphics
classes in xlisp-stat is to free the programmer from the event loop. 
But, it's making the event loop implicit that seems to cause some of 
these glicthes. ( In Forrest's case, I think that the fact that he
is NOT explicitly dispatching from the event loop is just what makes
the possibility that his actions may be interruptable by an externally
generated :redraw. )

 Multi-threading, would in fact, make most of these cases trivially
solvable. ( I'm not sure that it wouldn't produce a different set
of problems, though. )

 Typically, you don't much about at the event level. xlisp-stat, Tk, 
and some of the C++ graphics frameworks, like HyperCard, typically
try to hide the event loop ( or at least minimize your concern about
it ) and you define a bunch of ON-EVENT-DO type functions or classes
( In xlisp-stat's classes, they are things like :do-click, :redraw, 
:do-key ) and dispatching to those is what's done under the covers. 

 In my experience, xlisp-stat works pretty well cross-platform, but
[1] it presents higher level abstractions, so you don't run into many
  of the cross platform differences.
[2] it just doesn't provide interfaces to some of the other desirable
 but less portable features ( drag-and-drop or list-boxes, for example. )

Hi,

Does anyone know if the UNIX version of Xlispstat
works on DEC ALPHASERVER 8200 running DIGITAL UNIX 
(otherwise known as OFS/1) ?

Thanks.

It does raise it's own problems, but it should provide a clear way of
dealing with them and be ignorable if it isn't needed.

The problem Forrest came across does not arise on UNIX but it does on
the Mac and Windows because on these platforms multitasking with other
application requires cooperation, which is accomplished by
periodically checking for and processing certain events during long
running calculations (in the oscheck routine). This checking is where
user interrupts are detected on these platforms. On the Mac at least
it appears to also be necessary to process window update events in
order to get switching in and out of applications to work right; on
Windows repaint events don't go directly through the event loop so any
event checking ends up processing them (at least as i recall). This
more or less forces :redraw events to get handled at these times. The
net effect is that code executed from the listener window and event
processing is to a certain extent preemptively multitasked on these
platforms. All this isn't necessary on UNIX since UNIX does preemptive
multitasking of processes on its own. Windows 95 and NT do also, so
the Win32 version running on these platforms could dispense with the
event processing.

The need for multitasking of some sort arises in xlispstat because it
it is common to run moderately long calculations, and when you start
up such a calculation it is nice to be able to do something like go
read your mail.  On preemptively multitasking systems, like UNIX or
Windows NT, you don't need to do a thing to your program to make this
possible. On the Macintosh and Win16 you do. So one way or another the
ability to switch from a long running xlispstat calculation to another
program exists on all platforms. What doesn't exist, and would be
nice, is the ability to switch within xlispstat from a long running
calculation to some other activities, to background a long simulation
while you look at some plots for example. Adding preemptive threads
would make this possible. (You can do this in a heavy-weight fashion
on UNIX and Win32 by running two copies of xlispstat, but that is
usually not an optimal solution. Even that is very difficult on the
Macintosh.) As Steve points out, it would raise problems (like making
sure you don't clobber some of the data the long-running application
is using).  but it would also open up new opportunities, such as
taking advantage of multiple processors. It's not clear if it will be
worth it in the end, but finding out things like that is part of
research is this area of statistical computing.

Yes, Windows requires paint messages to be processed. Most messages can be
ignored or discarded  by a program that would rather do something else but
Windows will seize up if the .Paint method for a window is not called when
it want the window redrawn. You *could* have a dummy .Paint method that
didn't do any drawing but the synchronisation issues would still be there.

Version 3.47 (running on Solaris 4.1.3) appears not to invert 1x1
matrices.  For example, the command

(inverse #2A((0.017)))

produces the message

Error: incompatible with access indices - #(0.0)
Happened in: #<Byte-Code-Closure: #1eb2b8>

I noticed this because a program that worked on a machine running 3.44
suddenly stopped working.

lu-decomp and lu-solve don't have this problem.

A while ago, I wrote a parse-color function for the Mac, so I could
use the same color names on Mac as on Unix/X11 xlisp-stat. Recently,
I added some more color management routines, and, because I had to
redefine some procedures like ADD-COLOR, I reorganized the code to
put it all into it's own package. 

It worked well that way, except that now I've been running into
problems with the fact that the symbols returned by (color-symbols)
are sometimes interned in different packages, depending (I suppose)
on where and when they were defined/added. 

'BLACK, 'BLUE, etc. all seem to be external symbols from package XLISP,
which are inherited in package USER. 
However, some of the color symbols I added end up being interned in
another package - for example  'COLORS::PURPLE. 

This side effect has broken some of my other code that tries to 
select or restrict various sets of color. 

I can probably fix those functions to take that possibility into
account, but I wonder here about what is the "Right Thing" - i.e.
if colors are going to be passed around as symbols, shouldn't they
be keyword symbols ? Either that, or in their own package - the
rationale being that they need to be unique. 

Anyone have any ideas on the best ( but backwardly compatible )
way to handle this ?

I'm having trouble getting Xlisp-Stat to run on a SUN Ultra Sparc 170 and 
wonder if anyone has had similar troubles and can set me straight.  I am 
getting a linking error when make tries to use gcc to link a long list of 
*.o files in:
gcc  -o X11WINDOWSxlisp xsdynload.o xssystem.o unixprim.o .... etc.
      -L/opt/X11R6.1/lib -lX11 -ldl  -lm

The error message is:

So I guess I'm missing some include file.  I don't know enough unix to 
find the file which defines these variables, so can someone
  1)  tell me what file defines these, or 
  2)  tell me how to search libraries to find the definitions (Yuck)

Thanks.

Documentation for ViSta, the Visual Statistics System, is now available at
no cost in the form of Adobe Acrobat files, in addition to postscript
files. The documentation includes cover, contents, introduction, tutorial
and references. The documentation is the same for all operating systems. It
can be downloaded from the ViSta web site at
http://forrest.psych.unc.edu/research/ViSta.

For those of you who have not seen previous announcements about ViSta, a
previously posted announcement is attached to the end of this message.

We strongly recommend getting the documentation in the form of Adobe
Acrobat files because these files
  > are small
  > can be viewed on your computer screen
  > can be printed on any printer, not just postscript printers
  > are the same no matter what operating system you are using
  > are free

You must have Adobe's Acrobat Reader to use the Acrobat files. It is
available for free from Adobe at
<http://w1000.mv.us.adobe.com/Acrobat/Acrobat0.html>. Note: We do not
recommend getting the beta version of the next release of  Acrobat Reader
(called "Adobe Acrobat Amber") because in our judgment it is not yet
reliable enough.

You can also get the documentation in the form of postscript files from the
ViSta web site.  However, we recommend Adobe Acrobat files rather than
postscript files because postscript files are much larger, cannot be seen
on screen and can only be printed on postscript printers.

For those of you who have not seen previous announcements about ViSta, the
remainder of this message repeats previous announcements.

Announcing a New Release of
ViSta - The Visual Statistics System
Version 4.22, January 8th, 1996
Copyright (c) 1991-96 by Forrest W. Young

If you are using releases prior to 4.21 on a Macintosh or PowerMac, I
strongly recommend you obtain this new release, which is much more robust
due to fixes of two major bugs.

=======================================
What is ViSta?
=======================================

ViSta, is a Visual Statistics system that
> Performs univariate and multivariate data analysis and visualization
> Provides visual maps for summarizing and guiding analysis sessions
> Includes a data analysis language and a programming language
> Is open, extensible, and freely redistributable

PLATFORMS: ViSta is available for
> Microsoft Windows 3.1 (Windows 95 in preperation)
> Macintosh and PowerMac microcomputers
> A Unix version is in preparation

AUDIENCE: ViSta is useful for
> UNDERGRADUATES: Teaching introductory statistics to undergraduates
> GRADUATES: Teaching multivariate statistics, dynamic statistical graphics
>and computational statistics to graduate students
> RESEARCHERS: Research and development in dynamic statistical graphics and
>in computational statistics

ViSta is designed for an audience of users having a very wide range of data
analysis sophistication, ranging from novice to expert. ViSta provides
seamlessly integrated data analysis environments specifically tailored to
the user's level of expertise. Visual guidance is available for students
and novices, and graphical tools are available for teachers and other
experts to create guidance for these novices. A structured graphical user
interface is available for competent users, and a command line interface is
available for sophisticated users. The complete Lisp-Stat (Tierney, 1990)
programming environment is available to researchers, programmers and
graduate students who wish to extend ViSta's capabilities.

ViSta is "freely redistributable". This means that it is not in the public
domain, but that it may be freely copied and redistributed, with certain
restrictions.  See the COPYING and COPYVSTA files included in the
distribution for details.

=======================================
ViSta's main features
=======================================

> WORKMAPS
Maps that visualize the overall structure of an on-going data analysis
session.  These maps are created by ViSta as the data analysis session
progresses.  They aid novice and competent analysts in remembering their
analysis session, and permit the analyst to return to earlier steps of the
analysis.
> GUIDEMAPS
Maps that visually guide students and other novice data analysts through
their data analysis sessions.  These maps are created by experts using
ViSta's Authoring tools.
> SPREADPLOTS
Multi-window dynamic statistical graphics that visualize data structure and
analysis results
> MODEL RE-VISION
Dynamic interactive graphical tools that permit the user to visually
re-estimate model parameters
> ViDAL
ViSta's Data Analysis Language. ViDAL is an extension of the underlying
Lisp-Stat language that can be used by sophisticated data analysts for data
analysis and by programmers to enhance ViSta's capabilities.
> DATASHEET
A graphical datasheet for displaying and editing data.
> AUTHORING TOOLS
Visual tools for authoring new GuideMaps.

=======================================
Data Analysis Capabilities
=======================================

ViSta's data analysis capabilities include:
> DYNAMIC GRAPHICS
Histograms, Boxplots, Diamond Plots, Dotplots, Scatterplots, Biplots,
Spinplots, Scatterplot Matrices. Plots support brushing and labeling, and
are dynamically linked.
> DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
Means, Standard Deviations, Variances, Ranges, Quartiles, Medians,
Correlations, Covariances, Distances
>UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS
T- and Z-tests and confidence intervals for single sample, paired samples
and two independent samples data, with Wilcoxon Signed-Rank and
Mann-Whitney tests in appropriate situations.
> ANOVA
Univariate analysis of variance of orthogonal one- or multi-way data. Model
may or may not include two-way interactions.  The model visualization is a
spreadplot comprised of boxplot, diamond plot, quantile plot,
quantile-quantile plot and effects plot.
> REGRESSION
Simple and multiple OLS regression analysis (multivariate, robust and
monotonic regression in preparation). The model visualization is a
spreadplot comprised of a biplot, spinplot, histogram and
scatterplot-matrix.
> PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS
Analysis of correlations or covariances. The model visualization is a
spreadplot comprised of a biplot, spin-plot, scree-plot and
scatterplot-matrix.
> MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING
Analysis of one or more symmetric or asymmetric matrices. The model
visualization is a spreadplot comprised of a scatterplot, spin-plot,
scree-plot and scatterplot-matrix.  The spreadplot supports graphical
re-estimation of model parameters.
> CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSIS
Analysis of two-way contingency tables. The model visualization is a
spreadplot comprised of a biplot, spinplot, residuals plot and scree-plot.
The spreadplot supports graphical re-estimation of model parameters.

=======================================
Hardware Requirements
=======================================

MACINTOSH:
There are two versions of ViSta for the Macintosh, one for the PowerMac and
one for 680xx Macintoshes.  For 680xx Macs, we recommend a 68040 processor
(at the minimum, a 68030 + 68881 math coprocessor). Both versions require
System 7 or later, 3 MB of free hard disk space and at least 6 MB of RAM (8
for the PowerMac).

WINDOWS:
There are two versions of ViSta available for Microsoft Windows 3.1, one
for WIndows 3.1 with the WIN32S 32-bit extension, and one without. Both
require 3 MB of free hard disk space and 8 MB of RAM.  The Windows 95
version is in preparation. Versions for Windows NT and OS/2 are not
contemplated.  If you wish, you can try the 32-bit version of ViSta with 95
or NT or the 16-bit version with OS/2.  While I have not tried ViSta under
these operating systems, some people report positive results.  Let me know
your experience.

MONITORS:
We recommend at least a 14", 8-bit (256 color) screen, but 17" is
preferred. For 12-, 24- or 32-bit screens, a larger memory partition is
required (add 1/2 MB for 12-bit, 1 MB for 24- or 32-bit).

=======================================
ViSta is a work-in-progress
=======================================

ViSta is a work-in-progress.  Some features are incomplete. While quality
assurance testing has been done, this is a beta-release system that is not
fully mature.

At the current stage of development, ViSta is viable as a supplemental
statistical software system used for extra credit exercises in introductory
statistics, and as the focus of graduate courses on research in
computational and graphical methods in statistics.  It may be premature to
use ViSta in undergraduate statistics classes that need a complete and
robust statistic analysis system.

Currently, the Delete Data, Delete Model and Simulate Data menu items are
not implemented; the ANOVA visualization is incomplete; MULREG does not do
multivariate tests (it does many separate multiple regressions);
transformations are not available with matrix data; model interpretation is
unimplemented; and the Help and GuideMap systems are incomplete.

A univariate multiple regression module (which complements the current
multivariate multiple regression module with more extensive visualizations
and with the choice of robust or monotonic regression) is being written but
is not yet available. Multivariate tests, Redundancy Analysis and Canonical
Analysis are being added to the multivariate regression module.

1.  The function get-lambda-expression seems to have disappeared from
XLISP-STAT 2.1 Release 3.44 (Beta).  It is used in function savefun,
defined in common.lsp, but this of course fails:
> (savefun xxx)
Error: The function XLISP::GET-LAMBDA-EXPRESSION is unbound.
Happened in: #<Subr-TOP-LEVEL-LOOP: #3565b8c>

Is there some work-around?

2. The function equalp should be capable of comparing two structures.
However, the code for equalp in common.lsp does not do this.  How does one
compare two arbitrary structures?  You would need first to compare their
types with #'type-of.  If these are eql, then you could compare each field
of the structures in turn for equality.  However, to do this, one needs a
way of obtaining a list of the field names of a structure.  I can't see a
way of getting that.

Thanks.

It has been moved to function-lambda-expression, I think that following 
CL especification:



> (defun ppp (x) (list x x x))
PPP

> (function-lambda-expression #'ppp)
(LAMBDA (X) (LIST X X X))
NIL
PPP

I asked the list two questions.  Many thanks for the replies, which I
summarise below.

>1.  The function get-lambda-expression seems to have disappeared from
>XLISP-STAT 2.1 Release 3.44 (Beta).  It is used in function savefun,
>defined in common.lsp, but this of course fails:
>> (savefun xxx)
>Error: The function XLISP::GET-LAMBDA-EXPRESSION is unbound.
>Happened in: #<Subr-TOP-LEVEL-LOOP: #3565b8c>
>
>Is there some work-around?

The function's name has changed to FUNCTION-LAMBDA-EXPRESSION, to be in
accord with CLtL.  [Note: the next release of common.lsp should be changed
to suit].

>
>2. The function equalp should be capable of comparing two structures.
>However, the code for equalp in common.lsp does not do this.  How does one

The name of the constructor function and the field names and accessor
functions of a structure are stored on the property list of the structure's
type.

 Up until now, I have been using some very unoptimized Lisp code
for doing digital filtering of spectra. The original fortran 
code I'm translating and generalizing from uses a "top-hat" 
filter:

 +1		+---------------+
		|		|
		|		|
  0   --+	|		|	+--
	|	|		|	|
	|	|		|	|
 -1	+-------+		+-------+


( This is a bandpass filter that removes both hi-frequency and
  low frequency conponents. ) 


That code is currently the slowest non-graphics, non-io, bottleneck. 

I've been experimenting with some other ways to do it. 

[1] I've been poking around in the source for kernel-smooth to 
 see how that is done in xlisp-stat. I discovered that the 
 choice of kernels is hard coded in kernel.c. I added an additional
 case to C function kernel(): 

    case 'H':			/* sdm7g: TopHat filter */ 
/*    	w =   1.0 ; */
    	z =   2.0 * z ;
    	if (( -0.5 < z) && (z < 0.5 )) k =  1.0 ;
    	else if (( -1.0 <  z) && (z < 1.0)) k =  -1.0;
    	else k =  0.0 ;
    	break;

[ A case also has to be added to the xlisp function wrapper in linalg.c. ]


Which initially seemed to work, however I found that I had picked 
a lucky set of test parameters, because most of the time it didn't
work as I expected, but produced all zero results. 


In C function kernel_smooth(), I discovered the line:

    if (y != nil) ys[i] = (wsum <= 0.0) ? ysum / wsum : 0.0;

which I changed to:

    if (y != nil) ys[i] = (wsum != 0.0) ? ysum / wsum : 0.0;

which seems to fix the problem. 

There are no comments in this code, so I'm not sure what is intended.
Is this a 'bug' or a 'feature' ? 


[2] The above mods aren't really general enough for what I may need:
kernel-smooth takes a single width parameter along with the type code,
and I may need to control the widths of both the positive inner and
the negative outer filter lobes independently. I might also want to
try other filter kernel functions - sinc() for example. 

 * Does anyone else have a need for more generalized digital filtering ?
 * Is there something else already in lisp-stat for this that I missed ? 
 * Is there a real performance  advantage to doing it on the C language 
   level rather than in Lisp ? 
 * Anyone have any ideas about the best interface for a more generalized
   routine ? It might be nice to be able to pass a lisp defined filter
   kernel function, but would this kill any speed advantage of the C 
   code.

I guess that kernel-smooth is intended for use with non-negative
 weigth functions only.

I would suggest you using fourier transforms if you want flexible and 
fast filtering. I do that in my kde code entirely in lisp (together with 
some rounding, of course) 

In my opinion, C code for xlisp-stat must be good enough and interesting 
enough to convince Luke to include it in the 'official' distribution.

Here're two possibilities.

1. I wrote some smoothing code in lisp which I think is basically what
you'd do if you if the lisp code is fast enough.  It's simple code for
computing the convolution of a set of data points against a kernel.
I'm appending it to the end of this message.  This code is *very*
slow, but easy to use.  It also can be modified to be much faster in
special cases.  For example, if your data is 1 dimensional, and you're
using a box shaped kernel, you can sort the data first, and only work
with the points within the box.

2. If you're running xlispstat on a platform which supports dynamic
linking and loading of object code (running under Unix, say),
you could modify the above to work with kernels coded in Fortran (for
example).  Then, you could code up the kernels in Fortran, link them
on the fly into a running interpreter, and let the lisp code use the
Fortran kernels.  I can send you some modifications to xsdynload.c to
make this a little faster and easier, if your interested in this
route.  It gave me a factor of 10 speedup when I used this approach
with a nonlinear regression.

Good luck,

I would suggest Luke to include in xlisp-stat some basic routine (in 
compiled C, of course) for doing convolution. Most packages have it 
(Matlab, S+, ...) and this give them a clear advantage in simplicity for 
implementation of filetering, smoothing, etc...

cheers,

Frederic Udina

When I replaced the generic Lisp:
#-xlisp-stat
(defun sum-of-prod (&rest sss)
 "Sum-of-prod ( &rest sequences )
   reduces to sum of the element wise products of sequences."
 (reduce #'+
     (apply #'map 'vector #'* sss )))


with code that uses xlisp-stat's vectorizing functions:

#+xlisp-stat
( defun sum-of-prod ( &rest args )
    ( sum ( apply #'* args )))


I uncovered a bug in function sum.

The documentation says:

> ( help 'sum )
SUM
[function-doc]
Args: (&rest number-data)
Returns the sum of all the elements of its arguments. Returns 0 if there
are no arguments. Vector reducing.


However:

( sum #() )
#()
> ( sum () )
NIL
> ( sum )
Error: too few arguments
Happened in: #<Subr-SUM: #eb1c5c>

Zero not returned for any of the above cases.

[  My particular code  relied upon ( reduce #'+ #() ) ==> 0 :
   sum of product of empty sequences equals zero. ]

( Going back to the generic lisp code for now. )

*** Object methods can not return multiple values! ***

Not a particularly horrible limitation, unless it bites you unawares!

I happen to have gotten into the habit of using multiple-value
returns to return a value and it's associated standard deviation
or standard error, but it doesn't work for methods. Obviously,
the 'send' dispatching code wasn't designed to handle multiple
values.

I forgot to mark the internal send function as returning multiple
values. This will be fixed in the next release. If you are compiling
your own version, you can fix it by changing the line


{       "SEND",                         S, xmsend                      },

is osptrs.h with

{       "SEND",                         SM, xmsend                      },

All platforms, any version <= 3.47 -- it's in the common C code and
has been ever since multiple values were added.

Subject: Files bound to edit windows
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk

Is it true that it is impossible to obtain the pathname of the file which
the user is editing in an edit window (i.e. an instance of
edit-window-proto)?  It appears that the save file dialog in which the user
specifies the file name is buried within the XLisp C code and does not
emerge into the Lisp environment.  This also means that while you can
obtain the title of an ordinary window by sending the message :title to the
window object, in the case of edit windows, NIL is always returned.

If I am correct, could Luke consider adding some code to edit.c to allow
user code to get at the window title and/or file pathname?

Why would one want to know, anyway, you ask?  Here's one reason:

Assuming that you have an edit window open on the code you are developing,
to go through the edit-load-test cycle with Xlisp-Stat involves:

1. Make changes to the edit window.
2. Save the edit window (command-S).
3. Find the listener window behind the edit window, bring it to the front
4. Load the file (command L; open-file dialog; locate the file)
5. Run the code
 ... and repeat indefinitely.

Steps 2 - 4 could all be replaced by one menu command (say, "Save and
Load") but to write this command would require determining the name of the
file being edited.  That's what I can't do.

The UCLA Xlisp-Stat Archive regression section has been updated somewhat.
Its homepage at

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/develop/lisp/xlisp/xlisp-stat/code/statistics/regression

has been repainted and redecorated, and code is added by Thomas Lumley 
for Generalized Estimating Equations and by Bob Obenchain for ridge regression.

It's a very nice collection now. And quite inexpensive. If you want to
add material, feel free to send it to me. If you have a complete and
well-documented product, think about submitting to

I found this problem some months ago, and Luke confirmed me that the 
window name and the file name are not accessible.

Actually, you can
(send (front-window) :save)
and also :eval-selection
so the only part you can't do from xlisp-stat is to select all the text 
in the window!

LispForm uses Mathematica pattern matching programming to translate
some Mathematica expressions to lisp syntax.

LispForm.mma can be found in
ftp://ftp.upf.es/pub/stat/cosetes/LispForm/LispForm.mma
together with this text file.

The current version is really incomplete, I'm adding rules as I need
them, but ringht now you can convert most Mathematica expressions 
to a string your lisp interpreter can read and store.

For example, instead of the ugly expression

In[27]:= ListCoefs[2,2]

           2        2 2              2        2           2       4
Out[27]= {a  (-1 + a ) , 2 a (1 - 3 a ) (1 - a ), 1 - 12 a  + 15 a , 
 
                  2            2
>    4 a (-2 + 5 a ), -2 + 15 a , 6 a, 1}

using LispForm

In[28]:= LispForm[%]

you obtain the much more beatiful one

Out[28]= (list (* (sqr a) (sqr (1- (sqr a))))(* 2 a (* (+ 1 (* -3 (sqr\
 
>    a))) (+ 1 (- (sqr a)))))(+ 1 (* -12 (sqr a)) (* 15 (expt a 4\
 
>    )))(* 4 a (+ -2 (* 5 (sqr a))))(+ -2 (* 15 (sqr a)))(* 6 a)\
 
>    1) 


If you type in Mathematica

In[29]:= LispForm[some list of number pairs] >> somefile.lsp

you will get 

"(list (list -1.2 0) (list -1.1 0) (list -1. 1.2326e-32) (list -0.9 0.01)\
  (list -0.8 0.04) (list -0.7 0.09) (list -0.6 0.16) (list -0.5 0.25)\
  (list -0.4 0.36) (list -0.3 0.49) (list -0.2 0.64) (list -0.1 0.81)\
  (list -2.77556e-17 1.) (list 0.1 0.81) (list 0.2 0.64) (list 0.3 0.49)\
  (list 0.4 0.36) (list 0.5 0.25) (list 0.6 0.16) (list 0.7 0.09) (list\
  0.8 0.04) (list 0.9 0.01) (list 1. 1.2326e-32) (list 1.1 0) (list 1.2 0\
  )) "

in your file somefile.lsp. You migth need to supress the quotes before
using the file :<)

Feel free to use it, and please send me any improvement you make on it.

An earlier message about documentation for ViSta had the wrong web site
address for the documentation. The web site is correct in this message.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Documentation for ViSta, the Visual Statistics System, is now available at
no cost in the form of Adobe Acrobat files, in addition to postscript
files. The documentation includes cover, contents, introduction, tutorial
and references. The documentation is the same for all operating systems. It
can be downloaded from the ViSta web site at
http://forrest.psych.unc.edu/research/ViSta.html.

We strongly recommend getting the documentation in the form of Adobe
Acrobat files because these files
  > are small
  > can be viewed on your computer screen
  > can be printed on any printer, not just postscript printers
  > are the same no matter what operating system you are using
  > are free

You must have Adobe's Acrobat Reader to use the Acrobat files. It is
available for free from Adobe at
http://w1000.mv.us.adobe.com/Acrobat/Acrobat0.html. Note: We do not
recommend getting the beta version of the next release of  Acrobat Reader
(called "Adobe Acrobat Amber") because in our judgment it is not yet
reliable enough.

You can also get the documentation in the form of postscript files from the
ViSta web site.  However, we recommend Adobe Acrobat files rather than
postscript files because postscript files are much larger, cannot be seen
on screen and can only be printed on postscript printers.

For those of you who have not seen previous announcements about ViSta,
please contact me at the address in the signature below for further

Subject: copy-list woes inside methods
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk

I want to make a *temporary* change to a slot-value from inside a method,
and then change the slot-value back to its original value.  To do this, I'm
setting up a temporary variable to hold the original slot-value:

    (setf temp (copy-list (slot-value 'window-labels-loc)))

But then when I change the slot-value, TEMP also changes.  I've also tried
the following:

    (setf temp2 (slot-value 'window-labels-loc))
    (setf temp (copy-list temp2))

But TEMP still changes when I later change the slot-value.  I thought
COPY-LIST would overcome this problem.  Any comments or suggestions?


Thanks,

A simple test prototype demonstrates that copy-seq works as
expected inside a method for me ( using Mac Xlisp-Stat 3.47 ),
so that should not be your problem. However, I don't know if
copy-seq is recursive. What sort of values are in the lists
you are copying ?




( defproto thing '( a b ) () )

( defmeth thing :a (n v)
    ( setf tmp ( copy-seq (slot-value 'a)))
    ( setf ( elt tmp n ) v )
  tmp )

( defmeth thing :b (n v)
    ( setf tmp (copy-seq (send self :slot-value 'b )))
    ( setf ( elt tmp n ) v )
  tmp )

( defmeth thing :isnew ( a b ) ( slot-value 'a a ) ( slot-value 'b b ))

( setf it ( send thing :new ( iseq 10 ) ( iseq 10 )))



> ( send it :slot-value 'a )
(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
> ( send it :a 4 -4 )
(0 1 2 3 -4 5 6 7 8 9)
> ( send it :slot-value 'a )
(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)

Method :a (send self :slot-value 'a) or :b (slot-value 'b)  both
seem to give the expected identical results.

Reply-To: pcolsen@acm.org
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk

I want to be able to limit the printing precision in the SAVEVAR
command. 

As it stands now, I appear to be storing things with full precision
--- apparently 18-digits of mantissa (plus exponent).  Unfortunately,
I don't need all that precision and I would much rather trade it for
the savings in time and space that would result from saving only four
or five digits of mantissa.  

I like the robustness and generality of using a standard function like
SAVEVAR, so I would prefer not to write my own.

Any suggestions?

I'm looking for some suggestions to speed up code that must read and write
large matrices.  I would also like to speed up matrix multiplications and svd
calculations.  

I'm doing some calculations with svds of large matrices that are "very
tall and skinny" (on the order of 80000 rows and 30 columns).  The
matrices are not sparse and I need the singular values and both the
left and right singular vectors.

Hi,

I have problems with the compilation of xlispstat-3-44 on an RS/6000 
running AIX 3.2.5. The process stops after quite some time with the 
following error message:

cc -DUNIX -DNEWGC -DBYTECODE -DX11WINDOWS -O -D_BSD -qmaxmem=3000 
-qlanglvl=ansi -Imachines/aix/dynload  -DFOREIGNCALL -DIEEEFP -DANSI  -c 
cholesky.c
"./linalg.h", line 6.0: 1506-213 (S) Macro name abs cannot be redefined.
make: 1254-004 The error code from the last command is 1.

Maybe that anybody on the list was running in similar problems and has 
already found a solution.


Thank's in advance to anyone who is responding,

Max

Subject: Using PATH with popen ?
X-Disclaimer: These opinions are mine, alone.
Reply-To: pcolsen@acm.org

I'm writing to ask if anyone has been able to have popen search an
explicit PATH.

I'm using Xlispstat 3.47 to prototype a large application on several
different Unix hosts (including Suns with SunOS 4.0+, SGIs with Irix
6.2, and IBM RISC machines running AIX).  To maximize speed, I'm
preprocessing some data using external programs (like "find", "wc",
and some custom filters) called via popen.  

The problem arises because popen seems either to assume that the
executable is in the current directory or, if not, that it will
contain an explicit path.  Unfortunately, the explicit paths do not
seem to be constant across operating systems.  (For example, IRIX uses
/sbin/wc and SunOS uses /usr/ucb/wc.)  There are several possible
work-arounds (like writing lisp code to find an explicit path to each
executable), but all of them seem to be horribly kludgy when all I
really need is to have popen search the path itself.

I will appreciate any suggestions.

I seem to have discovered a problem in the function "directory-files".

I'm developing a large Xlispstat application on another machine
(which, unfortunately, isn't connected to the internet).  I say
"unfortunately" because the "directory-files" function has taken to
returning "nil" as a result even when (system "ls") shows that there
are files in the directory --- and I can't easily include the dialog
leading to the error (at least without typing several hundred lines of
text).  The one consistent precursor seems to be calling something
like

(popen "find directory -name '*.exten' -print")

in a way that returns a Unix error (as when, for example, directory
does not exist).  As my users may do exactly this (for example, by
calling the enclosing routine with a typo), and my application depends
heavily on (directory-files), I'd be really appreciative of any ideas.

   I wrote and posted a common lispish directory function in C that
I use on the Mac. It OUGHT to be portable to unix, as it's using
posix-y systen calls, but I haven't actually tested it anywhere but
on the Mac. I'll be happy to send you a copy if you want to recompile
and give it a try.
  The common lisp manual was not specific about what the result of
directory on an invalid pathname should be, but since there is no
corresponding portable 'stat' function, or some equivalent to check
whether a file is a directory or a plain file, I made it return Nil,
to make it simpler to recursively descend directories.
  It only returns a list of files in the directory pathname arg -
no filename globbing, although simple matching is easy in lisp:

  ( remove ".ext" (directory d) :test-not #'string-search )

or use the pathname functions.

Hi,

I would like to redirect the output of a lispstat command into a shell 
command. Is this generally possible and if yes, how could I do it?

Example:

Piping the output of the command...

> (select (send current-model :labels) (send plot :selection))

("Volvo 240 GL" "Peugeot 694 SL")

...into a shell-script.

Max

maciviewwindow2.c [Mac xlispstat 3.47] contains the following code,
which is the source of some of the color bugs I had previously reported:

VOID set_fore_color(StGWWinInfo *gwinfo)
{
  if (gwinfo->drawColor < NumBasicColors)
    ForeColor(get_color(gwinfo->drawColor));
  else RGBForeColor(get_rgb_color(gwinfo->drawColor));
}

VOID set_back_color(StGWWinInfo *gwinfo)
{
  if (gwinfo->backColor < NumBasicColors)
    BackColor(get_color(gwinfo->backColor));
  else RGBForeColor(get_rgb_color(gwinfo->backColor));
}


Both functions set the foreground color -- the second function
should be calling RGBBackColor() instead.

With this change, setting the background color to a non-built-in
color works correctly. I am also now able to copy color graphics
into the clipboard without colored regions being lost - something
that was previously not working for me, but I have also made some
changes in the Lisp code for scatterplot :redraw-content and
some other methods, so I'm not sure which changes have fixed that
problem.

  I've been rewriting some of my spectral data classes and considering
writing some classes for handling tabular data, and I thought I'ld
take a look at what you've done in Vista before re-inventing something
similar. I'm impressed with some of the Vista user interface! ( I
really like the workmaps and guidemaps. )
  After a quick look at the code in dataobj*.lsp and tablobj*.lsp,
it looks [1] too complex for what I need and [2] too monolithic to
just steal a piece of it. ( But that's just a first impression based
on a really quick look. )
  Is there any programmer-oriented documentation, in addition to
the PostScript User docs ? Or a guide to importing data into Vista,
or writing a datafile that it will accept ?

 In Luke's "Recent Developments and Future Directions..." paper, he
mentioned the desirability of a more complete data object model, to
avoid having to incompatibly reinvent similar functionality. If
I find I can't make use of your data objects, perhaps we need some
discussion of what sort of base classes would be useful in the
base implementation.

For another approach, see

ftp://ftp.stat.ucla.edu/pub/xlispstat/code/utilities/edit/cellsheet

or the older one in

ftp://ftp.stat.ucla.edu/pub/xlispstat/code/utilities/edit/spreadsheet

or the even older one in

ftp://ftp.stat.ucla.edu/pub/xlispstat/code/statistics/introstat/uclastat

I think the cellsheet solution is fairly nice, the scrolling list
solutions are pretty awful.

Who was it that sent the message to this group about wanting to write a
table data object? I wanted to reply but got the message just before I left
town for a week, and now I can't find it.  If someone sends it to me again,
I'll reply.

Unfortunately, I think you came to the right conclusion on the basis of
your quick look (it doesn't take a long look to see the problems in trying
to re-use my messy code :-(  ).

I suspect that you'll find you can't use my code as you would wish.
Furthermore, the table data object is the worst part of the data object
code.  I feel good about the basic approach I took in the multivariate data
object, and a little less good about the matrix data object, but the table
data object is a real kludge that I want to get rid of.

Yes, there is more documentation than is on my server.  Right now there is
a completed chapter on getting data into ViSta, as well as three completed
analysis modules chapters.  There also is a somewhat out-of-date chapter
(that I'm updating) that is oriented towards the programmer who wants to
write new model objects.

I believe that without too much effort I could extract the multivariate
data object from ViSta and make it a stand-alone XLS object. It could then
be used as an object for other data types to inherit from. I also have
several stand-alone XLS graphical objects and a stand-alone n-way anova
object that I could make available.  Perhaps Luke would want to include
them in his distribution if I documented them? Is there any discussion of
this? Would others find that useful?

Is there any way to change the values set in XLS preferences on
the fly from withing Xlisp-Stat ?  ( In particular, I would like
to switch between a large and a small graphics font: large for
viewing on a full screen, small when I'm clipping a smaller size
version into the clipboard to paste into a report. )

  I could use the n-way anova -- I'm currently using oneway-model, but
it really should be a two way analysis.

  I also have some graphics objects: I have completely rewritten my
overlay code ( this is the third try, at least. I think I've finally
got it "Right". ) The first module (realgraph.lsp) is pretty much in
its final form. The second ( jitterplot.lsp ) is my first use of it --
which led to some changes in realgraph.lsp - it may go thru some
changes, but is a good example of how to use the realgraph overlays.
I have not yet gone back and changed my content-overlays objects to
use and be compatible with these classes. ( The new classes are a
better implementation, they appear to be faster and cleaner, and they
fix some of the color problems I had run into, for example, clipping
graphs into the mac clipboard preserves fill colors, which were getting
mysteriously lost before -- I suspect by that erase of  the content
region. )

  realgraph.lsp:
    redefines scatterplot-proto :REDRAW-CONTENT method to
    :REDRAW-DATA-LINES and :REDRAW-DATA-POINTS without doing an erase
    of the content region.

    redefines graph-overlay-proto :graph to be a setter as well as a
    getter, and redefines GRAPH-PROTO :ADD-OVERLAY & :DELETE-OVERLAY
    to use it, so that the overlay objects can be hierarchical and
    graph binding can be propagated. Adds :bring-to-front methods
    to graphs and overlays.

    Defines a REAL-GRAPH-OBJ-PROTO which defines common methods
   (:REAL-TO-CANVAS, :RESIZE, :REDRAW, etc. ) for overlay objects
   drawn with real coordinates.

	RECT-PROTO
	OVAL-PROTO ( also implements ARC with optional args )
	LINE-PROTO
	POLY-PROTO
	POINTS-PROTO
	LABEL-PROTO


    COMPOSIT-GRAPH-OBJ-PROTO
      join primitives together with :ADD-PARTS, and access them with :PARTS
      propagates graph, line-color, line-width, fill-color changes to parts.


Jitterplot.lsp:
  JITTERPLOT-PROTO: "jittered" ( randomized in the x direction so points
  don't fall on top of each other, and density of points is not obscured.)
  and groups data sets. example:
   (send self :group-points n :point-color 'blue )
   (send self :group-points n '( :point-coordinate 1 ))

  BOXPLOT-PROTO (the standard boxplots, but as an overlay that has
  settable :line-width :line-color :fill-color ) and DISTRIB-CLOUD-PROTO
  ( ovals with major radius equal to multiples of the standard deviation,
   and centered around the mean or weighted mean line. ) are specific
  COMPOSIT-GRAPH-OBJ-PROTO descendants.

A snapshot of the code and some gifs of example plots are at
<http://minsky.med.virginia.edu/sdm7g/Projects/XlispStat/>

A screen dump from the old content-overlay code is:

I'll release a final version after I have reconciled the old code to
the new graphic overlay objects.

   but I'm going to break this long message up into two parts. The 2nd

I want ahead and implemented my own table-proto: it takes an array
with the first row containing the field/class names, and constructs
named accessor methods for each column. An :indexes method returns
the row indices of all of the rows that match a given test
( the default test is #'string-search ), which can be used to
select the elements of the desired column. More complicated selections
can combine or intersect the lists of indices, for example:

  ( select ( send table :CA_CONC )
           ( intersection ( send table :indexes :GROUP "Control" )
                          ( send table :indexes :STRUCT "Cyto" )))

pulls out the CA_CONC column for all the observations/rows where
GROUP column contains the string "Control" and STRUCT column contains
the string "Cyto".

This manages to do the thing which was puzzling me when I wrote the
initial help message -- I need to extract data into one of my sequence
data types which are subclasses of COMPOUND-DATA-SEQ: Typically, I
am matching my row selectors as above, but I need several columns for
each data sequence -- for example NAME, CA_CONC, CA_CONC_STD_DEV.

I have found that using a consistent data-sequence object interface
makes life a lot easier.
 Consistant access methods allow :PLOT methods to automatically label
points and axes correctly, scale plot to regions of interest rather
that max,min data points, handle data overlays and linking, consistent
coloring of overlays, etc. ( An example that I haven't yet implemented:
all of my points in my CA_CONC distribution plots have :NAME's, which
are displayed when that point is selected. Typically those names are
the same as the filename of the spectrum which was analyzed to give
that concentration. [ The "R25-11" in the plot at
<http://minsky.med.virginia.edu/sdm7g/Projects/XlispStat/Ca-conc.box.full.gif>
for example. ] So, not only can I link Calcium concentration plots
with Phosphorus concentration, but, if I add something to keep track
of the root pathnames for my data sets, I can make double-clicking on
a suspicious outlier point automatically bring up the spectrum plot of
the data from which that point was derived. )


That is why I would like to see a similar data model and programming
conventions standardized, both for sequences and 2 way tables.

Actually, EVERY data element OUGHT to be able to be a composite object,
with a NAME slot, a VALUE slot, and a slot for variance/std-dev. or some
other associated statistic linked to the data value. In Python, there
isn't such a big split between objects and built-in data types, so it
would be easier to extend without diving into the implementation. In
XlispStat, this might require the same sort of global modifications
that were done to add vectorized arithmetic operations.

If there were some standard slots and accessors, it would also
make converting to or from other dimensional data objects or tables
easier. ( like extracting a column of data from a table, and building
a compound-data-seq, as described above. )


Following is a summary of the  COMPOUND-DATA-SEQ objects I'm using
in my current app. ( Some methods may migrate from one class to
another, as I rationalize the design a bit more and try to figure
out how to better integrate singletons, sequences and tables of
data and conversion between them. [ I think the most important
thing to standardize beyond COMPOUND-DATA-SEQ itself, is turning
them into first class generic sequences in GENSEQ -- that is
what makes the rest of the package work! ]

 [ "The grass is always greener, except at t=0" - Stan Kelly-Bootle ]





GENSEQ.LSP
   redefines length, elt, (setf (elt ... )) to work on COMPOUND-DATA-SEQ
   objects, which allows them to be used in most functions that expect
   a generic sequence of some type.  Vectored functions like +, *, etc.
   already work for COMPOUND-DATA-SEQ, but PLOT-LINES and some other
   functions expect a LISP sequence and fail when passed a sequence
   object. This mod fixes all of the cases I've found so far.


DATASEQ.LSP
 DATA-SEQ-PROTO defines a basic subclass of COMPOUND-DATA-SEQ
   with slots/accessors:

   	NAME & COMMENT strings

   	NAMES & COMMENTS  sequence of strings
      [info on each observation/data-point]

	STD-ERRS ( or standard-deviations, but will probably change
	this to variances or inverse variances/weights - to optimize
	calculations and to be more consistent with weighted regression,etc.

	and methods:

		:MEAN ( &key weighted T )
		:STANDARD-DEVIATION
		:PRINT ( prints summary info -- I will probably shorted
			this and  add a separate :SUMMARY method )
		:PLOT  ( a distribution/boxplot )

XYSEQ.LSP:
 XY-SEQ-PROTO:
	inherits from DATA-SEQ-PROTO.
	IS-A Ordered data sequence
	adds slots/accessors:
		:OFFSET ( or initial X )
		:dx
		:units
	and methods:
		:X
		:Y ( is an alias for the data-seq )
		:X-RANGE
		:Y-RANGE
		:DIFFERENCE
		:MEDIAN-SMOOTH (actually called :MEDIAN -- should change name)

		( :COLOR is here, but I'm not sure where it really belongs.)
		:PLOT is redefined to be
			PLOT-POINTS (send self :X) (send self :Y)

SPEC.LSP:
 SPEC-PROTO:
	Adds methods to convert between CHANNEL-NUMBER or INDEX X coordinates
	and real valued X values. Shifts, subsequences, zero-padded extended
	sequences, etc. ( actually everything miscellaneous that didn't quite
	make it into the application specific XES ( X-ray Energy Spectra )
	classes.

 XES-PROTO
 XES-REF-PROTO
   Add bandpass filtering functions, overlay plotting functions, and most
   of the application specific data functions.

;
;OVERVIEW:
;   The primary function in the code below is "polish-plot" which
;   enhances the capabilities of the typical two dimensional plots
;   available in Xlisp-Stat.  The main objective of this code is
;   to create plots which are better suited for final output to a
;   printer.  The function polish-plot adds the following
;   attributes to two dimensional plots.
;
;ADVANTAGES:
;o  Enables log-linear, linear-log, and log-log scale plotting.
;   The logarithm base may be chosen by the user.
;
;o  A title and multiple labels may be placed inside the plot
;   window, and will be redrawn automatically when the plot
;   is redrawn.
;
;o  Function curves may be added which are represented by line
;   segments, as with the :add-function method, but whose line
;   segment end-points are equally spaced in the X direction
;   even when the X axis is log scaled.
;
;o  Formats for labeling the major tick marks can be set.
;
;o  Minor tick marks can be included on linear or log scaled
;   axes, and the number of minor ticks can be specified.
;
;o  The minimum X or Y value for a plot may be offset by a
;   specified amount from the axes' intersection so that points
;   and curves are not plotted immediately at an axis line.
;
;o  X and Y axis tick marks are labeled with horizontal strings
;   so that chunky bitmapped images are not obtained when plots
;   are sent to a printer.
;
;DISADVANTAGES (known):
;o  Brushing does not work on log scaled plots.
;   Note:  This was a conscious decision between two alternatives -

Now that background colors are finally working on Mac XlispStat
[ see previous posts for source fix ], I find you can draw a nice
background grid with the contrast reduced sufficiently so that it
doesn't distract too much from the data.

I assume that bug was Mac specific, so this should work on other
platforms that support color, but you also have to use the modified
:redraw-content that I also posted sometime back, so that it
doesn't erase the content area.


Add the following methods ( :draw-grid, :grid-color and modified
:redraw-background )  to scatterplot-proto and try
something like:

;; assumes ( setf plot SOMEPLOT ... )
  ( add-color 'ghostwhite )
  ( add-color 'gray80 )
  ( send plot :back-color 'ghostwhite )
  ( send plot :grid-color 'gray80 )
  ( send plot :redraw ) ;; or resize or uncover the plot

Hi

I have hit a baffling problem with XLISPSTAT 3.45 under Windows on a PC.
The thing is, it should be quite simple.

In order to decide how many tick marks to put on the y-axis of a graph,
I need to calculate the y axis range, then add 1 (to get 1 tick per
value).

The following function returns the range

(defun yRange (numList)
	(- (max numList) (min numList)))

However, when I use this function in the following statement 
(anova 2 is the graph and the y axis range = 10):

(send anova2 :y-axis t t (+ 1 (yRange (send anova2 :range 1))))

I get the following error:

Error: bad argument type - 10

The problem does not appear to be with the function, but with any argument
returned as a result of sending a message to the graph.  Any other way
of generating the result '10' seems fine.


Any thoughts would be most welcome.

James

Subject: Additional Vista documentation
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk

Additional chapters of documentation for ViSta are now available. The new
chapters are on defining data, and on regression analysis and
correspondence analysis. The contents and references have been updated. The
introduction  and tutorial are still available but are unchanged.
Additional chapters on exploring data, on each of the remaining analysis
modules, and on adding analysis and visualization methods to ViSta are in
preparation.

===============================

The documentation is the same for all operating systems.  However, it
exists in three forms:
1) Adobe Acrobat pdf files (for any operating system)
2) Postscript in the form of MSWindows zipped files
3) Postscript in the form of self-extracting-archive files for Macintosh

We recommend Adobe Acrobat files because they:
> are small and download quickly (postscript files are much larger).
> can be viewed on your screen (postscript cannot be viewed on screen).
> can be printed on any printer (postscript only prints on postscript printers).
> are the same for all operating systems (postscript is compressed
>differently for different operating systems).

Note that to display and print the Acrobat files you must have the Adobe
Acrobat Reader. It is available from Adobe at no cost from
http://w1000.mv.us.adobe.com/Acrobat/Acrobat0.html.

No special software is needed for postscript files.

===============================

You can obtain the documentation in three ways:

1) World-Wide-Web
Any of the three forms of the documentation may be downloaded from the
ViSta world-wide-web server at
http://forrest.psych.unc.edu/research/ViSta/doco.html.

2) FTP
You may ftp any of the three forms of the documentation from the ViSta ftp
site at www.psych.unc.edu/pub/forrest/vista.

3) Mail
You may obtain hardcopy of the documentation by sending a check or
international money order. It should be in US dollars and drawn on a US
bank. It should be made payable to "UNC Psychometric Lab" in one of the
following amounts:
>USA & Canada: $10.00US
>Mexico: $15.00US
>Elsewhere: $25.00US
Mail the check or money order to the address in the signature of this message.

===============================

For more information about vista, visit the ViSta web site at the www
address in the signature, or request more information at the address given
below.

Try as I might I can't seem to break away from XLS...To wit, I have
encountered a small problem that I would like to solve/understand.
When I try to fit a glim model of the binomial family, I have no
problems with the default link, i.e.
(binomialreg-model logdose r n)
but when I ask for a probit link I get this error:
Error: The variable PROBIT-LINK is unbound.
Happened in: #<FSubr-UNLESS: #8c182ddc>
Now...I only get this if I ask for the probit link as I first enter the
session.  If I first run the default log link then I can, for the rest of
the session, ask for the probit.  Why and how do I solve it.
Thanks!!!

This is a bug in the simple-mindedn autoload facility -- only function
or macro calls trigger an outoload, not variable references. For now
you need to explicitly load the glim system if you want to use the
probit link -- this will hopefuly be fixed soon.

animal breeders, statistical geneticists and molecular geneticists)
and a large Statistics department (offering also classes in
statistical genetics and biostatistics), providing the possibility
for interaction and auditing of classes. There is also interaction
with a Human Genetics group in Richmond, VA, including Drs.
Charles MacLean and Mike Neale. Finally, the computing facilities
are excellent (departmental high-end, multi-processor workstation,
computing center workstations, symmetric multi-processor and SP2 
systems, and supercomputing access at the Cornell Theory Center).

How hard would it be to mate to Xlisp ?

Subject: SWIG and the netCDF library interfaces

With all the discussion about adding the Java interface and with
Rob Managan <managan@llnl.gov> mention about a Python interface.
I thought I would bring up the tool SWIG which allows one to take
C (and C++) code and interface with Tcl, Perl, Python, or Guile.
I have not tried it yet but it seems like a very easy way to add
netCDF to these scripting languages.  And it might be extendable
to Java.  More information is available at
        http://www.cs.utah.edu/~beazley/SWIG/
It is something to consider.  Below is part of the web page.

SWIG
Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator

Introduction

SWIG is an easy to use tool that lets you add Tcl, Perl, Python, or Guile to
programs written in C and C++. Normally, this requires you to write special
"wrapper" functions---a process that is both tedious and error-prone. SWIG freesyou from this task and allows you to focus on the application at hand while
providing all of the benefits of using an interpreted scripting language
interface.

A brief overview of features

       Supports Tcl, Perl4, Perl5, Python, and Guile-3.
       Allows you to add C/C++ functions, variables, and constants.
       Handles almost all C datatypes and pointers.
       Run-time type checking of pointers.
       Automatic documentation generation in ASCII, LaTeX, or HTML.
       Extends common applications including tclsh, wish, and expect.
       Can be extended to support new target languages.

Subject: Problem installing xlispstat 3.47 on Solaris 5.4
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu

I am trying to install xlispstat 3.47 on a Sun under OpenWindows (`uname
-a` yields: SunOS kennedy 5.4 Generic_101945-32 sun4m sparc).  Configure
runs without apparent error.  The Makefile compiles and loads without
errors until it comes to loading xlisp to compile backquote, when it dumps
core with a segmentation fault.  The final few lines from a log of the make
are:

echo "(compile-file \"compiler/backquot.lsp\") (exit)" | ./xlisp

; loading "init.lsp"
; loading "common.lsp"
; loading "common2.lsp"
; loading "common3.lsp"
*** Error code 139
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `compiler/backquot.fsl'

Can anyone provide some clues about the source of the problem?  Has anyone
else succeeded with an installation under Solaris?

Many thanks for any help.

3.46 compiles fine on Solaris 5.3. The problem is that there are a few
places where setjmp/longjmp combinations don't fully protect local
variables. Usually this only creates problems when code is optimized
-- sun's optimizer probably got more aggressive with 5.4. I had fixed
these problems in my working version (gcc tells you what the potential
problems are) but there are too many other little changes to easily
extract these changes. For now, the simplest solution is to compile
the three affected files,

	xlbcode.c
	xlcont.c
	xlisp.c

without optimization.

I'm using the code below ( on Macintosh Xlisp 3.47 ) to add common
directories to the file menu. It works more or less as it should
 -- it adds directories to the file menu, and it sets them as
the current working directory. If I try to load a filename from
that directory, it works as it should. However, when I do an
(open-file-dialog), it doesn't  start up in the current working
directory. Any idea why it doesn't or  how it can be forced ?
The whole reason for adding these shortcuts was to avoid having
to climb in and out of directories with the open-file dialog!!

3.47 uses the CodwWarrior chdir routine for setting the working
directory. THis routine does not do what is needed to make the
OpenFileDialog adjust. Messing with where OpenFile Dialog starts up is
oe of those things the Mac doesn't make easy. The only way I know of
doing it invilves messing with low memory globals, which is considered
dangerous for portability. If I find a cleaner way to do it, I may
make this change.

To All Lispers:

My experience is that on the Mac there is no solution to this problem. 
Directories seem to work right under MS-DOS and Unix. Not Macs.

Some of you may know about tcl/tk, an interpreted language plus
X11 interface toolkit from Berkeley, very popular. Ousterhout, the
father of tcl/tk, now works for Sun, and Sun develops tcl. They
just produced a nice plugin for Netscape, so that you can now run
tiny tcl/tk programs in the browser window (like applets). If
somebody would do the same thing for Xlisp-Stat, we would really
be in business.

Announcing a Unix Version of
ViSta - The Visual Statistics System
Version 4.22a, July 22nd, 1996
Copyright (c) 1991-96 by Forrest W. Young & Anthony Rossini

ViSta is now available for Unix!

ViSta for Unix requires X11R5 or higher (it has been tested on X11R6 and
X11R6.1), and a recent version of XLispStat (version 3.44 or higher). This
version has been developed and tested on a IBM PC-compatible notebook
(486DX4-100) running Linux, a Sun SPARCStation 20/50 running Solaris 2.4
and 2.5, as well as Sun IPC and IPX workstations running SunOS 4.1.3.

Version 4.22 of ViSta for MS-Windows and the Macintosh has been previously
announced and is currently available from the server described below.

The complete code for ViSta, including documentation, test data, examples,
help, guidance, and the XLisp-Stat base, is available from our WWW and FTP
servers.

WWW: http://forrest.psych.unc.edu/
FTP from www.psych.unc.edu, directory pub/forrest/vista.

The remainder of this message summarizes earlier messages about ViSta.

=======================================
What is ViSta?
=======================================

ViSta, is a Visual Statistics system that
> performs univariate and multivariate statistical data analysis and
>visualization
> is open, extensible, and freely redistributable

PLATFORMS: ViSta is available for
> Microsoft Windows 3.1
> Macintosh and PowerMac microcomputers
> Unix with X11R5 or higher

AUDIENCE: ViSta is useful for
> UNDERGRADUATES: Teaching introductory and multivariate statistics
> GRADUATES: Teaching multivariate, graphical and computational statistics
> RESEARCHERS: Research and development in dynamic statistical graphics and
>in computational statistics

ViSta is designed for an audience of users having a very wide range of data
analysis sophistication, ranging from novice to expert. ViSta provides
seamlessly integrated data analysis environments specifically tailored to
the user's level of expertise. Guidance is available for students and
novices, and tools are available for teachers and other experts to create
guidance for these novices. A structured graphical user interface is
available for competent users, and a command line interface is available
for sophisticated users. The complete Lisp-Stat (Tierney, 1990) programming
environment is available to researchers, programmers and graduate students
who wish to extend ViSta's capabilities.

ViSta is "freely redistributable". This means that it is not in the public
domain, but that it may be freely copied and redistributed, with certain
restrictions.  See the COPYING and COPYVSTA files included in the
distribution for details.

=======================================
ViSta's main features
=======================================

> WORKMAPS
Maps that visualize the overall structure of an on-going data analysis
session.  These maps are created by ViSta as the data analysis session
progresses.  They aid novice and competent analysts in remembering their
analysis session, and permit the analyst to return to earlier steps of the
analysis.
> GUIDEMAPS
Maps that visually guide students and other novice data analysts through
their data analysis sessions.  These maps are created by experts using
ViSta's Authoring tools.
> SPREADPLOTS
Multi-window dynamic statistical graphics that visualize data structure and
analysis results
> MODEL RE-VISION
Dynamic interactive graphical tools that permit the user to visually
re-estimate model parameters
> ViDAL
ViSta's Data Analysis Language. ViDAL is an extension of the underlying
Lisp-Stat language that can be used by sophisticated data analysts for data
analysis and by programmers to enhance ViSta's capabilities.
> DATASHEET
A graphical datasheet for displaying and editing data.
> AUTHORING TOOLS
Visual tools for authoring new GuideMaps.

=======================================
Data Analysis Capabilities
=======================================

ViSta's data analysis capabilities include:
> DYNAMIC GRAPHICS
Histograms, Boxplots, Diamond Plots, Dotplots, Scatterplots, Biplots,
Spinplots, Scatterplot Matrices. Plots support brushing and labeling, and
are dynamically linked.
> DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
Means, Standard Deviations, Variances, Ranges, Quartiles, Medians,
Correlations, Covariances, Distances
>UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS
T- and Z-tests and confidence intervals for single sample, paired samples
and two independent samples data, with Wilcoxon Signed-Rank and
Mann-Whitney tests in appropriate situations.
> ANOVA
Univariate analysis of variance of orthogonal one- or multi-way data. Model
may or may not include two-way interactions.  The model visualization is a
spreadplot comprised of boxplot, diamond plot, quantile plot,
quantile-quantile plot and effects plot.
> REGRESSION
Simple and multiple OLS regression analysis (multivariate, robust and
monotonic regression in preparation). The model visualization is a
spreadplot comprised of a biplot, spinplot, histogram and
scatterplot-matrix.
> PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS
Analysis of correlations or covariances. The model visualization is a
spreadplot comprised of a biplot, spin-plot, scree-plot and
scatterplot-matrix.
> MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING
Analysis of one or more symmetric or asymmetric matrices. The model
visualization is a spreadplot comprised of a scatterplot, spin-plot,
scree-plot and scatterplot-matrix.  The spreadplot supports graphical
re-estimation of model parameters.
> CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSIS
Analysis of two-way contingency tables. The model visualization is a
spreadplot comprised of a biplot, spinplot, residuals plot and scree-plot.
The spreadplot supports graphical re-estimation of model parameters.

=======================================
Hardware Requirements
=======================================

MACINTOSH:
There are two versions of ViSta for the Macintosh, one for the PowerMac and
one for 680xx Macintoshes.  For 680xx Macs, we recommend a 68040 processor
(at the minimum, a 68030 + 68881 math coprocessor). Both versions require
System 7 or later, 3 MB of free hard disk space and at least 6 MB of RAM (8
for the PowerMac).   We recommend at least a 17", 8-bit (256 color) screen
(14" minimum). For 12-bit or 24-bit screens, a larger memory partition is
required (add 1/2 MB for 12-bit, 1 MB for 24-bit).

WINDOWS:
The Windows version of ViSta is for MS-Windows 3.1 with the 32-bit
extension. Users report that this version of ViSta also works under Windows
95, though no testing has been done. This version requires 3 MB of free
hard disk space and 8 MB of RAM. We recommend at least a 17", 8-bit (256
color) screen (14" minimum). For 12-bit or 24-bit screens, more memory is
required (about 1/2 MB for 12-bit, 1 MB for 24-bit).

UNIX:
ViSta for Unix requires X11R5 or higher (it has been tested on X11R6 and
X11R6.1), and a recent version of XLispStat (version 3.44 or higher). Thus,
if you don't have XLispStat you must download it first, then download
ViSta. The version has been developed and tested on a IBM PC-compatible
notebook (486DX4-100) running Linux,
a Sun SPARCStation 20/50 running Solaris 2.4 and 2.5, as well as Sun IPC
and IPX workstations running SunOS 4.1.3.

=======================================
ViSta is a work-in-progress
=======================================

ViSta is a work-in-progress.  Some features are incomplete. While quality
assurance testing has been done, this is a beta-release system that is not
fully mature.

At the current stage of development, ViSta is viable as a supplemental
statistical software system used for extra credit exercises in introductory
statistics, and as the focus of graduate courses on research in
computational and graphical methods in statistics.  It may be premature to
use ViSta in undergraduate statistics classes that need a complete and
robust statistic analysis system.

Currently, the Delete Data, Delete Model and Simulate Data menu items are
not implemented; the ANOVA visualization is incomplete; the univariate
analysis visualization is not available; MULREG does not do multivariate
tests (it does many separate multiple regressions); transformations are not
available with matrix data; model interpretation is unimplemented; and the
Help and GuideMap systems are incomplete.

A univariate multiple regression module (which complements the current
multivariate multiple regression module with more extensive visualizations
and with the choice of robust or monotonic regression) is being written but
is not yet available.

=======================================
Documentation
=======================================

The following two monographs describe how to use ViSta:

"ViSta, The Visual Statistics System", is available from the server
mentioned above. A nicely bound and printed version is also available for
$5.00 from the address below.

"ViSta Corresp", a description of the Correspondence Analysis procedure in
ViSta, is available for $5.00 from Forrest Young at the address below.

Subject: Can't change cursor
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk

I have some code roughly like this (where 'w' is an instance of
graph-window-proto) :

	(send w :cursor 'watch)
	.... some computation...
	(send w :cursor 'arrow)

The intention is that while the computation is proceeding, the user is
reminded to wait by the watch cursor.  However, the cursor does not change.
It only changes when I abort the computation using command-.   This is so
even if 'w' is the front (active) window.

I also have a menu attached to 'w' which contains a menu item, 'Pause'
which sets a flag.  This flag is checked during the computation and if
found to be true, the computation stops.  This works.  However, the menu
item also has an associated key, command-P, and pressing this does not
have any effect.

What am I doing wrong?

The windows and mac versions make an effort to check for a user
interrupt and to give other applications a chance to run during long
computations. Whether or not anything else happens is not predictable
(other keystrokes, changing cursors, etc.). The current solution is a
hack. To properly support doing anything useful while at the same time
doing a long computation meas supporting doing two separate thigs at
once, i.e. some form of proper multitasking. THis is on my list of
things to add.

Announcing a slightly revised release for the Unix Version of ViSta - The
Visual Statistics System (Version 4.22a, July 22nd, 1996).

The examples in the examples directory of the recent release of ViSta for
Unix were not properly converted from Mac format to Unix format, resulting
in problems in using them.

This formatting problem has been fixed. The revised version is now
available from the ViSta server.

A preliminary version of a cox regression package is available from 
http://www.biostat.washington.edu/~thomas/cox.html

It fits stratified proportional hazards models with left truncation and 
right censoring using either the Breslow or Efron approximations for tied 
failures.  Only very limited diagnostics and graphics are as yet available.

Some testing has been done against S-PLUS and SPIDA, but it's still alpha 
code.

Does anyone know of any code for performing multiple comparisons?
I am particularly interested in Dunnett's test.  Any guidance would be
much appreciated.

Can anyone give me some advice/information on how to invoke other
applications from within XLISP-STAT on Macs or pc's?  

I know how to access system shells from within XLISP-STAT in a UNIX 
environment to run other processes, but do these other platforms have the
ability to perform  tasks (like multimedia etc) from within XLISP-STAT?



Just curious.

On the Mac side, there is a mechanism called Apple Events which allows
processes to send messages to each other.  Standard messages are
start, stop, open file and print file, but specific applications can
define their own.  XLISP-STAT support for apple events is described in
the release notes (at least for the Mac version), but you will
probably need to read the chapter on apple events in Inside Macintosh
to understand what is going on.

There is a newer technology for this sort of thing called "OpenDoc"
currently in a beta release, but as far as I know, XLISP-STAT is
neather an OpenDoc container or component.

On the Windows side, I think XLISP-STAT supports the OLE protocols,
but I don't do Windows so I can't tell you any more.  Check the
release notes.

Dynamic Graphics Workshop

University of Glasgow

Tuesday 24th September 1996, 10am-4.30pm

Over a number of years the use of graphical presentations as part of
data exploration and analysis has been steadily increasing.  This has
been made possible by the increasingly graphical nature of computer
interfaces and is having the effect of making data analysis more
interactive.  An important point is that pictorial representations of
data can help students to see how the data and the underlying problem
relate to each other in a way that numerical summaries do not.  This is
particularly true of those for whom statistics is not their primary
interest, but a tool of their main discipline.  In short graphics help
them to see what is going on more easily than numerical summaries,
because most people think visually.

The scope of static graphical presentations can be extended by a newer
type of graphic called a dynamic graphic.  Dynamic graphics are very
similar to their static cousins except that certain aspects can be
changed very rapidly without a complete redraw.  Graphs can be built up
sequentially with the process of building the graph being part of the
teaching and learning exercise.  

The CTI Centre for Statistics is organising a workshop to introduce
people to the possibilities offered by statistical packages that can 
perform interactive (or dynamic) graphics.  The workshop will feature one
free package, XlispStat (available for PCs, Macs and Unix machines), and
two commercial packages, namely DataDesk (only available for Macs) and 
JMP (now available on both PCs and Macs).

The workshop will involve a short introduction and 30-45 minute
presentations on each of the packages, concentrating on their use in
teaching.  This will be followed by a hands-on session during which
participants will be able to try some simple exercises devised by the
presenters, and also to try out some other things for themselves.  It
will be up to the participants what they spend their practical sessions
doing, but all the presenters will be on hand to help and to discuss use
of the packages and interactive graphics in general.

The registration fee for the workshop is 30 (60 for those outwith the
UK HE sector), which covers lunch. For a fee of 34 (64 for non-UK HE),
attendees will also receive a copy of our "Maths&Stats Guide to Software
for Teaching". This book lists several hundred statistics packages, and
includes descriptions and contact information. The combined workshop and
book fee represents a saving of 2 on the normal Software Guide price. 

Please note that an administration fee of 5 will be levied for
cancellations less than 14 days prior to the workshop.

Could anyone help me with a piece of advice on installing XLispStat.

In the compilation of xsivint.c, the compiler interprets the evaluations 
(w == nil) and (w != nil) in line 219 and 341 respectively, as operations
between unsigned long and pointer to void, and thus considers them illegal.

In this institute we run AIX on an RS6000 machine. The configure statement
yields 

GRAPHSYS = X11WINDOWS
X11INCDIR_FLAG =
X11LIBDIR_FLAG =
UCFLAGS = -O -D_BSD -qmaxmem=3000 -qlanglvl=ansi -Imachines/aix/dynload
ULDFLAGS = -bE:xlisp.exp -bM:SRE
EXTRALIBS = -lld
EXTRAOBJS = dlfcn.o
IEEE_FLAG = -DIEEEFP
ANSI_FLAG = -DANSI
FOREIGN_FILE = sysvr4-foreign.h
FOREIGN_FLAG = -DFOREIGNCALL
CC = cc

Any piece of advice is greatly appreciated as the software looks promising
to me.

Thanks a lot

By the definition above, WINTERP also supports dynamic graphics, via a
nice object oriented wrapper to the Xtango high-level
graphics/animation library.  See http://www.eit.com/software/winterp
for details. The current release is a bit old, as I am not permitted to
work on "free software" at my current job. I do have a new release in
the works, but I will not be able to release it while continuing
employment at EIT/Verifone. I hope to remedy this soon by not working
at this job sometime in the near future (any pointers, especially on
positions outside the USA would be appreciated!).

Here's some further info:

--------------------

WINTERP: An object-oriented rapid prototyping, development and delivery
environment for building extensible applications with the OSF/Motif UI
Toolkit and Xtango-based graphics/animation.
			by Niels Mayer
			WINTERP Version 2.03
			July 24, 1994

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For information on the latest version of WINTERP, and other information (under
construction), see the World-Wide-Web/Mosaic "WINTERP Home Page":
	URL -- http://www.eit.com/software/winterp/winterp.html
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WINTERP is a Widget INTERPreter, an application development environment
enabling rapid prototyping of graphical user-interfaces (GUI) through the
interactive programmatic manipulation of user interface objects and their
attached actions. The interpreter, based on David Betz, Tom Almy, et al's
XLISP-PLUS, provides an interface to the X11 toolkit Intrinsics, the
OSF/Motif widget set, primitives for collecting data from UN*X processes,
and facilities for interacting with other UN*X processes. WINTERP thus
supports rapid prototyping of GUI-based applications by allowing the user
to interactively change both the UI appearance and application
functionality. These features make WINTERP a good tool for learning and
experimenting with the capabilities of the OSF/Motif UI toolkit, allowing
UI designers to more easily play "what if" games with different interface
styles.

WINTERP is also an excellent platform for delivering extensible or
customizable applications. By embedding a small, efficient language
interpreter with UI primitives within the delivered application, users and
system integrators can tailor the static and dynamic layout of the UI,
UI-to-application dialogue, and application functionality. WINTERP's use of
a real programming language for customization allows WINTERP-based
applications to be much more flexible than applications using customization
schemes provided by the X resource database, OSF/Motif's UIL (user
interface language), and resource-based languages such as WCL.

An environment similar to WINTERP's already exists in the Gnu-Emacs text
editor -- WINTERP was strongly influenced by Gnu-Emacs' successful design.
In Gnu-Emacs, a mini-Lisp interpreter is used to extend the editor to
provide text-browser style interfaces to a number of UN*X applications
(e.g. e-mail user agents, directory browsers, debuggers, etc). Whereas
Emacs-Lisp enables the creation of new applications by tying together
C-implemented primitives operating on text-buffer UI objects, WINTERP-Lisp
ties together operations on graphical UI objects implemented by the Motif
widgets. Both achieve a high degree of customizability that is common for
systems implemented in Lisp, while still attaining the speed of execution
and (relatively) small size associated with C-implemented applications.

Other features:
	* WINTERP is free software -- available via anonymous ftp from
	  ftp.x.org.
	* Portable -- runs without porting on many Unix systems.	
	* Interface to GNU Emacs' lisp-mode allows code to be developed
	  and tested without leaving the editor.
	* Interactive programming also available in the "WINTERP Control Panel",
	  with editing taking place in a Motif text widget controlled by
	  WINTERP.
	* Built-in RPC mechanism for inter-application communications.
	* XLISP provides a simple Smalltalk-like object system.
	* OSF/Motif widgets are real XLISP objects -- widgets can be
	  specialized via subclassing, methods added or altered, etc.
	* Automatic storage management of all Motif/Xt/X data.
	* Contains facilities for "direct manipulation" of UI components.

The WINTERP 2.0 release includes the following new features:
	* High-level, object-oriented 2.5D graphics/animation package featuring
          pixel-independent/resizable/scalable rendering, path-transition
	  animation, and high-level animation operators. This is based on
	  Stasko&Hayes' Xtango system.
	* Using Xtango, the ability to easily create new widget classes
	  employing arbitrary graphical behavior without the tedium of
	  programming in the Xt instrinsics and Xlib.
	* Asynchronous subprocess facility enables non-blocking GUI interfaces
	  to existing interactive unix commands and interactive network
	  services. Enables use of multiple asynchronous subprocesses.
	* XmGraph widget for creating directed acyclic graphs, trees, and
          direct-manipulation displays.
	* Table widget allows constraint-based GUI static layout
          using tbl(1)-style specifications.
	* Uses XLISP-PLUS version 2.1c -- more functionality, better subset of
	  Common Lisp, e.g. good support for sequence operators.
	* Support for OSF/Motif 1.2.*
	* GIF Image Support.
	* Many new examples, improved example WINTERP applications.
	* Major code cleanups, bug fixes, etc.

The Xlisp-Stat archive now has a directory

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/archive/xlispstat/code/incoming/

which has code that is not yet classified and moved to its
final destination.

I am also working on the HTML pages for the sub-directories,
but this is a slow process.

The new setup of the archive is illustrated by following

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/archive/xlispstat

then go to code, then go to statistics, then go to categorical,
then go to glim

thus there are no links to actual lsp files (because on our
system they would execute instead of display), but the links
are to directories showing the files, and you can drag them
(netscape, cyberdog) or url-get them or display them (if
you do not have Xlisp-Stat as a helper).

At the lowest levels of the hierarchy I will try to put README
files, because these show up so nicely in netscape directory
windows and in fancy ftp clients. If you submit files, it
would be nice to take this into account.

Bond, Udina, Naras, and I are writing an Xlisp-Stat book, 
which will probably come with the archive on a CD, which is
why it has to be nice.

Has anyone had any experience with XLispStat on MS-Windows 95?  Will the
latest versions (alpha or prior) for Windows (3.xx, I guess) work on
MS Win 95?  

(this isn't for me -- it's for my classes) Any information would be
helpful! 

thanks,
-tony

I've been using the 32-bit version of Lisp-Stat (version 3.45, I think)
with Windows 95, and it has been working just fine.

A colleague has asked me about computational errors in xlispstat,
running on the Sun version (SunOS 4.1), and I found errors all over the
place...

I seem to find more errors than correct answers!  Does anybody else get
the same errors on SunOS 4.1?

I checked these out on the HPUX version also, and got the correct
answers there.

I recall a discussion of math errors on SunOS 4.1 a few years ago
where the final culprit was a math library; and the error could be
fixed by applying a library patch (supplied for free by
Sun). Unfortunately, I couldn't track down any of the news/email
documenting the problem and the patch to apply.

The problem is not in arithmetic but in printing. If you are using
SunOS 4.1 you either need to upgrade to 3.45
(ftp://stat.umn.edu/pub/xlispstat/Alpha) or apply the patches for 3.44
and SunOS 4.1 available in
(ftp://stat.umn.edu/pub/xlispstat/SunOSPatches)

This may explain why my cox regression code (running on SunOS 4.1) gives 
errors that differ in about the fourth significant figure from those 
given by S-PLUS.

I take it this applies to Unix, but not Mac and MSDos?

This does not affect the Mac or Windows versions. It could affect some
other UNIX systems, but the only one I know of is SunOS 4.1. If your
UNIX has a memmove routine then it is definitely not affected. If it
has no memmove but its memcpy routine handles overlapping regions
properly then it is also unaffected. SunOS 4.1 did not yet include
memmove but had changed its memcpy to one that did not work with
overlapping source and destination. The source fixes avoid the problem
by providing a proper memmove if none is available.

Announcing a major new release of
ViSta - The Visual Statistics System
Version 4.23m, September 15th, 1996
Copyright (c) 1991-96 by Forrest W. Young

ViSta is a free statistical system that performs univariate and
multivariate statistical data analysis and visualization. ViSta is
available for Microsoft Windows, MacOS, and for Unix with XWindows from our
WWW and FTP servers at:
   WWW: http://forrest.psych.unc.edu
   FTP: www.psych.unc.edu, directory pub/forrest/vista.
A complete description of ViSta's capabilities, including examples, is
available at the WWW site. A brief description, including a list of new
features, is given in this message.

AUDIENCE: ViSta is useful for teaching multivariate statistics, statistical
graphics and computational statistics; and for research and development in
statistical graphics and computational statistics. ViSta is designed for an
audience of users having a very wide range of data analysis sophistication,
ranging from novice to expert. ViSta provides seamlessly integrated data
analysis environments specifically tailored to the user's level of
expertise. Guidance is available for students and novices, and tools are
available for teachers and other experts to create guidance for these
novices. A structured graphical user interface is available for competent
users, and a command line interface is available for sophisticated users.
The complete Lisp-Stat (Tierney, 1990) programming environment is available
to researchers, programmers and graduate students who wish to extend
ViSta's capabilities.

CAPABILITIES: ViSta's data analysis and visualization capabilities include:
exploratory graphics and descriptive statistics; univariate tests and
visualizations; analysis of variance; regression analysis; principal
components analysis; multidimensional scaling and correspondence analysis.
All analysis methods have extensive visualization features.

NEW FEATURES: The new version focuses on new (and improved) data analysis
and visualization methods. The major new features in this version include:
1) Multiple Regression, including OLS, robust and monotonic regression.
2) Redundancy analysis (regression with multiple responses).
3) Extensive visual regression diagnostics.
4) A visualization method for Univariate Analysis.
5) A completed visualization method for Analysis of Variance.
6) An improved visualization method for Multivariate Regression.
7) A multivariate regression test.

Currently, the new version is only available for the MacOS. The new version
will be available for MS-Windows soon. The Unix version will follow.

Those of you who use the archive may have noticed a few changes in
the last couple of days. 

(a) The classical Apple directory icons have been replaced by the 
System 8.0 directory icons. Macintosh will live !

(b) The foo.lsp files have been renamed foo.lsp.txt This is for the
benefit of those (such as us) whose WWW browsers are set to execute
foo.lsp files and to display foo.txt files. 

Otherwise changes are minor. Some of the lisp is updated an improved.
We'll try to indicate this with server side includes that give
the last revision date. Generally, the interface is improving and
information about the files in various forms is added. This is a 
slow process. 

New submissions are welcome.

 Jan: 
    Anywhere in the archives -- or elsewhere -- is there material on the
steps needed to make lsp a helper for a browser?  Just a pointer would be
welcome.  I don't want you to spend your time writing me a how-to if it
doesn't already exist.

A first draft of notes on my
Xray Energy Spectra analysis package written in LispStat,
the LispStat graphics and data class framework used, and
notes on the modifications, changes and bug-fixes made to
the 3.47 LispStat sources, as well as Macintosh PPC binaries
and CW9 project and modified sources are temporarily available
at:

<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Docs/xesapp.html>

The application itself is alpha/experimental, but it includes
fairly stable version of some code I had previously posted
for color-graphics overlays, linkable objects, jitterplots,
and some other parts of the basic framework.

Although the application is somewhat specialized, the framework
classes used to build it are intended to be general extensions
to XLispStat.

I hope to have more complete documentation, as well as final
versions of the code available soon. My usual web server has
been down and I've been too busy coding and documenting to take
time to get things back as they were -- thus the temporary site
above. I don't expect to have time to set up the old site for
several weeks or more.

If anyone could tell me how to place clipboard info into a variable i   
would be grateful.
(msw-paste) "displays" the contents of the clipboard but how do I put   
that data into a variable? (def x (msw-paste)) doesn't work.

Subject: histogram oddities...
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu

On the PowerMac XLispStat Version 2.1 Release 3.44, creating a histogram with:

    (def hp (histogram (iseq 8)))

and then resizing the plot by simply clicking and dragging on the resize
button on the bottom right of the histogram window has resulted in four
different histogram shapes:

        * * * * * * * *
        ---------------         (type 1 - uniform as one would expect)

        *
        * * * * * * *
        ---------------         (type 2)

        *       *
        * * *   * * *
        ---------------         (type 3)

        *   *   *   *
        *   *   *   *
        ---------------         (type 4)

In each case, (send hp :num-bins) returns 8.

Any comments?

Ditto for  2.1 Release 3.47 (Beta) on a Sun.
So at least it is the same logic on all platforms....

I wrote some time ago about this bug. I was thinking it has been fixed but...

I think that this is a serious bug for a system that pretends to be 
used by statisticians!

There are some packages written in XLS to do right histograms and 
other... but anyway, I think the bug might be fixed.

ftp.upf.es:/pub/stat/anchor-position
can be a posibility

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/archive/xlispstat/code/statistics/plotting/my-histogram/
is another one

The project

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~deleeuw/courses/153a/outlines/

may be of interest to some people on this list. It is changing
very rapidly each day, and will continue to change at least
during this quarter.

Technically, it is done with a combination of the pphtml
and latex2html preprocessors. The pages are written in 
LaTeX, using html.sty, and the rawhtml environment.

Suggestions are welcome.

LispStaters:

Does anyone know the difference between the :residuals and :raw-residuals
messages for Lukes regression-model-proto? Does it have to do with
weighting? If so, what?

The only thing I see about this is on page 201 of Luke's book, but there
doesn't seem to be any explanation.

:raw-residuals are the observed-fitted values
:residuals are multiplied by the square root of the weights (ie 
approximately constant variance if you ignore the leverage correction)

This information is in the object documentation (as well as in the 
source code)

Thanks for your replies. I guess I should have tried the help first (though
over the years, I've become conditioned not to, I guess :-)  ).

Subject: hiding name-list windows
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu

Hi,

This is the first time I've posted here and this may be a really stupid
question but here goes.

I'm trying to create a text window using a function which constructs the
list of text from data stored in an object. It then uses the name-list function
to create and display the window. I want to hide this window after it's been
created.  The :hide-window message doesn't seem to work.


(defun make-text-window object)
   .
   .
   use name-list to create the window containing text
   .


(setf some-window (make-text-window object)) <----- This works.

(send some-window :hide-window)  <----- This doesn't

Error: bad argument type - NIL
Happened in #<Subr: SEND: #53d960>

Since name-list-proto inherits from graph and graph-window-proto(s),
I don't understand why this won't work. I'd appreciate any insites
including workarounds.

Thanks in advance,
Art

A simulation study I am doing inside xlispstat is producing postscript
files that I want to convert to GIF or JPEG for insertion in a Web page
about the work.  

Does anyone doing something similar know of publically available method of
doing this?  (In my case SunOS is more convenient than MacOS which is
better than MS-Windows.) 


Jan deLeeuw has been kind enough to help me figure out how I can have
dynamic displays for folks who have xlispstat as a .lsp helper for their
browser.  But I also need to provide static inline alternatives for the
majority of people not willing to set that up.

Hi...I recently was moved (dragged) from a Mac to a PC and am accessing

XLS from the UCLA site.  When I double click on the .EXE file it
downloads it as nonsense code (binary?) and when I save it and try to

download (and have) but would like to know if anyone has any experience	
with Netscape on a PC.

Thanks for any aid!!

  A simulation study I am doing inside xlispstat is producing postscript
  files that I want to convert to GIF or JPEG for insertion in a Web page
  about the work.  

  Does anyone doing something similar know of publically available method of
  doing this?  (In my case SunOS is more convenient than MacOS which is
  better than MS-Windows.) 

Ghostscript is a free (GNU licence) postscript interpreter which I
think can be programmed to send its output to a file.  I forgotten
what kinds of formats are supported, but if it doesn't have the one
you want, you should be able to use the package PBMplus to do the
conversion.  

I think that most of these tools are available for both Unix and
Windows environments.

In the Mac world, there is a shareware program called Graphic
Converter which I would recommend.

BTW, GIF is probably better than JPEG for most statistical graphics.
GIF uses a nearest-neighbor based compression scheme which is very
efficient with line drawings (it can compress the large areas of
constant color efficiently).  JPEG uses a harmonic analysis which is
great for photographs with continous color gradations but is not very
good at the step functions in most line drawings.

An interesting problem, I could also use such a converter.
Searching with archie for pstogif I find:

Host wcarchive.cdrom.com
    Location: /.11/netlib/parkbench/gbis/bin
           FILE -r--r--r--      1840 May 16 21:40 pstogif

And the associated files in that directory which seem to be needed.  It 
uses ghostscript to do the conversion.

Has anyone used this?

Try to find a program like ghostscript. Run it with something like:

gs -sDEVICE=gif8 -sOutputFile=x.gif x.ps

This will create x.gif. Some new versions of gs do not support
gif (because of some unclear patent problems) but you can
produce, say, .bmp or .ppm with a similar command and
convert that bitmap format to .gif with a program such
as xv (un Unix) or alchemy (on DOS) and, surely, tens
of others.

LispStaters:

Here's something else I can't figure out:

I want to put up a simple dialog box that says "Please wait while
computations finish", that stays up until computations are finished and
which then disappears. I want it to have no buttons, and to be dismissed
automatically at the right time (i.e., I don't want a button that is
clicked to dismiss it).

The following puts up the desired dialog box on Macs:

(setf dialog (send modal-dialog-proto :new
  (list (send text-item-proto :new "Please wait until computations finish."))))

And then when time is right, do:

(send dialog :remove)

However, under windows it puts up an empty box (I havn't tried it under
unix). But anyway, this doesn't feel right to me, since nowhere are we
doing a
(send dialog :modal-dialog). I am missing somthing? This sounds simple, but
I feel like I can't figure it out. (Have I already figured it out and this
is a Windows bug?)

Hi XLispstaters:

What is the most efficient way of duplicating graphic windows
along with the contents from within a lispstat function ?

Thanks for any help.

Consider

echo "(plot-points (iseq 10) (normal-rand 10))" | lsp2gif.sh

where lsp2gif.sh is the file
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh
echo $1 | xlispbatch | tek2ps -s 75 > tmp.ps
gs -q -dNOPAUSE -dNO_PAUSE -sDEVICE=ppmraw -sOutputFile=tmp.ppm tmp.ps -c quit
pnmflip -rotate270 tmp.ppm | ppmtogif 2>/dev/null
rm tmp.ps tmp.ppm  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
and where xlispbatch is a version of xlispstat which does not write
a banner.

This produces a gif file with the plot produced by Xlisp-Stat on
stdout, and thus this can be called from a WWW page.

See

This is a combination of the Mikkelsen and Almy material, quite
a bit is sadly out of date, but the general idea is to upgrade
this over time 8-(

Hi, new to list.

In XLISP-STAT, How does one enable multi-line editing for
edit-text-item-proto, under MS Windows?

Also, how is the text-item-proto class different from the
edit-text-item-proto class, given that the :isnew for both of them have a
parameter which sets whether the text is editable or not? I think there's a
similar situation with some of the other classes.

The last I knew (i.e., version 3.45), this wasn't possible. There is a
version 3.47 that I havn't tried.

See below for something not directly related to Xlisp-Stat, but
will may try to combine it with the spin-proto at some point.
=======================================================================
At

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/calculators/

I have added a VRML spinplot in CGI (inspired by Webster West of
the University of South Carolina).

You type in three columns of data (or you paste), and submit the
form. If your browser knows about the MIME type x-world/x-vrml
it will display the plot as a VRML world, in which you can walk, 
point, rotate, switch on the light, and so on. Points are
represented as little spheres, size and color of the spheres
is adjustable in the form.

Best representation by Netscape 3.0 and the Live3D plug-in, but
there are other options (for UNIX there is a problem, unless
you have an SGI, or unless you are willing to set up Liquid
Reality). 

If the browser does not know about x-world/x-vrml, then it will
suggest you download the file. You can then view the downloaded
file in vrweb, or whurlplug, or whatever.

There will be updates to use more VRML capacities.

Hi,

I mostly use the Mac Xlispstat.  When I change the color, 
I cannot use the make-color command.  It seems to be a bug
for the Mac version. I tried the folloing two cases.
Two lines (one is yellow, and the other is violet) shall be
drawn if the system works correctly. 
  But on the Macintosh version the case 1 does not work 
properly. On the windows version the case 1 does work.
The 2nd case of course works on the both versions.

Does anyone know the color bug-fixed version for the Macintosh?
I would like to present the color images on the Lispstat window.

;;; color-change test
;;;

(setf w (send graph-window-proto :new))
(send w :use-color t)

;;; case 1


(make-color 'my-color 1 1 0)
(send w :draw-color 'my-color)
(send w :draw-line 50 50 100 100)

(make-color 'my-color 1 0 1)
(send w :draw-color 'my-color)
(send w :draw-line 100 50 50 100)


;;; case 2

(make-color 'my-color1 1 1 0)
(send w :draw-color 'my-color1)
(send w :draw-line 50 50 100 100)

(make-color 'my-color2 1 0 1)
(send w :draw-color 'my-color2)
(send w :draw-line 100 50 50 100)

Make sure you turned color use on in your window, for example with

Has anybody tried to connect to a data base from XLispStat?

At the moment I try Mini SQL, an SQL-Server on a Decstation that is free
of charge for universities. However I need to communicate with it with a
C library or with a script language like Perl. This approach quite
cumbersome to me, as I know none of the two languages.

TIA

Have you looked at the comp.lang.lisp FAQ?  While I'm willing to bet
that nobody has done it specifically for Xlisp, it is a fairly common
Lisp problem and their may be some public domain solutions which can
be adapted to xlisp.  (I know we did a proprietary one between Allegro
CL and OOR database while I was at StatSci).

Also, somebody at University of Washington wrote some code to link
Xlispstat and Splus.  It occurs to me that you might be able to adapt
that to your needs.

I'm afraid that if you are working with database, then into each life
some SQL must fall.  I suspect that whatever your solution, you will
either need to manipulate or generate SQL, Perl or some similiar data
manipulation language statements within Xlisp and send them to you
database.  The alternative is to read the entire data table into
Xlispstat and use the manipulation equations there.  This will be much
slower as Xlisp simply isn't optimized for database operations like a
true database system.

There is one color bug in the 3.47 Mac version that I know of --
see:
 <http://www.med.Virginia.EDU/~sdm7g/XES/MacXLS/Changes.to.3.47/>

I don't know if that is the source of your problem, or if that
bug exists in earlier versions. 


A compiled Mac PPC binary with this and some other fixes, and modified 
CW9 sources and project files are available at:
  <http://www.med.Virginia.EDU/~sdm7g/XES/MacXLS/dist/>

[ I have CW10 projects and 68K binaries that haven't been moved to 
  the server. I haven't had time to test them on a 68K machine yet, 
  but they seem to work (slowly) with SoftwareFPU installed on my
  PowerMac. If anyone wants to to test them out let me know. ] 


BTW: 
 Since XlispStat on the Mac has no 'print' function for graphics,
 I had been cutting and pasting my graphs into other programs -
 I tried WordPerfect, and a couple of image conversion or paint
 programs with various levels of success. I've just recently started
 using Claris Works, and I discovered if you paste you graph from 
 LispStat into a Claris Works DRAW document, the graph can be UNGROUPED
and various elements can be edited - 
 you can change the text fonts or the background colors, for example.
( changeing the color or thickness of lines is rather tedious, though,
 because once you ungroup the graph, each line segment is a separate
 line. )  This obviously implies that the quickdraw command sequence,
 and not just the resulting image bitmap is being cut and pasted -
 which also means that you get full printing resolution.

This is a brief follow-up to Steven Majewski's earlier note. If
you copy an Xlisp-Stat window to the clipboard, it becomes a
PICT file, which contains the info in the picture in vector
format. It can be edited in SuperPaint, Cricket Draw, MacDraw,
Claris Works, and so on. You can also get the information out
with DeReZ or ResEdit (see Inside Macintosh, Imaging with
QuickDraw, Appendix A, table A3 for the opcodes, and Listing
A-7 for a sample version 1 picture). As Steven remarks, this means
that the clipboard contains all the information for 600 dpi
printing, bypassing the bitmap, and functions that convert to
gnuplot or xfig are not needed on the Mac.

I would be interested in knowing if there is anyone out there who has
crafted in Xlisp or Xlisp-Stat anything analogous to GRAPHER.DCOM that was
one of the library functions in the InterLisp-D programming environment.
This was an extremely versatile tool for creating, modifying, and
incorporating tree structures used for inference nets in AI-related
programs. GRAPHER was an integral part of the Prospector program USGS
inherited from SRI.

I am afraid that this version also include bugs.
It is impossible to change the color table assignment.
This means that the number of colors handled is restrected
to the size of the color table.  In my experiences the
lates Mac version can manipulate less than 110 colors.
In the case of Windows version we can use as many colors
as we wish without regard to speed.

I need 256 colors. Do you have any idea?

OK - I didn't understand the problem the first time around... 

In maciviewwindow2.c are the constants:

#define NumBasicColors 8
#define NumRGBColors 128	/* sdm7g  up from 100 */

The latter was 100 in the original source code. I had bumped it
up to 200 in a previous build, but then reduced it in the current
version. You can try setting it to 255. 
( I'll try that on my next build, but I'm hoping to finish several
other changes before I'm ready to post a new one. )

Please note that if we can change the color table allocation, 
the size of the color table does not matter so much.  I do not know
the size of the color table in the case of the PC Window version.  But
perhaps we could handle the millions color if the hardware were
availabel. Because we could easily change the color tabel allocation,
using 'free-color' in case of the table full of colors.

I hope that you will be able to release the version with capability of
changing the color allocation table.

It took much time for sorting the data sets of size 10000.

> (def x (normal-rand 10000))
X
> (time (def y (sort-data x)))
The evaluation took 60.35 seconds; 0.20 seconds in gc.
Y

In the 3.44 version it took not so much.
The followings are the results:

I haven't made any changes to sort-data, so I have no idea why
there is a difference. I'll look into this though. 
[ I don't have 3.44 source on hand, so I don't know what else
may be different in 3.47 ] 

Any other significant differences when running the test ? 
For example,  amount of memory allocated for the program 
( Do a "Get Info" on the executables. ) 
You might also want to run it several times and average the 
values.

There does not seem to be a null-deviance calculated anywhere.
The simplest way is probably to fit a model without an intercept and with a 
single predictor which is a column of 1s and use its deviance

The code for sort-data did not change between 3.44 and 3.47 -- both
use the C library routine qsort (for better or worse). It is possible
that Metrowerks changed that routine between the two compiler releases
used. Another possibility (maybe related) is that somehow some 68K is
being used in the new version instead of native PPC code -- though
eventhat usually only accounts for a factor of 10 slowdown.

My macs are in a state of disrepair at the moment. Once they get back
up I'll see what gives in the newest CodeWarrior and replace qsort if
necessary. I've been meaning to replace it by a merge sort sooner or
later -- maybe it will have to be sooner.

I didn't follow this at first -- a bit too subtle for me :-).

The problem is that in case 1 mycolor is redefined without first being
free'd. The intent was that you call free-color before reusing a color
symbol.  I consider this use an error, but currently no error is
signalled and the exact results are implementation dependent. I'll
signal an error in future versions.

A while ago I posted a question about the problems I was having
with the current directory used by the Standard File Dialogs 
and the current directory set and returned by the 
get|set-working-directory functions not tracking each other.

You can control whether the standard file dialogs should update
the working directory via an optional parameter. The default is
to track, so 
  ( open-file-dialog ) 
updates the current working directory to the one from which you
chose a file ( No change if you Cancel dialog ) and,
  ( open-file-dialog Nil )
prevents the current-working-directory from being updated by
the dialog. 

However, the other direction did not work -- you could not "preload"
the directory where the Standard File Dialog would begin.

A couple of lines added to chdir() in dirent.c appears to fix this.

( You don't really need the defines, but I started translating from
the Pascal example in the Inside Mac Files volume, and I used the
same names as their example before I found the Metrowerks Note to
use the LowMem.h functions. ) 

Not extremely tested ! I only ran it a couple of times on my Mac
but it seemed to work properly with no problems. 

No additional error checking -- If you're going to have a problem
from stuffing ints into low memory globals, they are going to 
show up in some other odd way. But it ought to repeat the check
on dd_error before trying to set the values. I'll change that
in the final version and post it on <http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g>
with the other mods. ( probably not right away -- as noted in 
another thread, I'm going to try to finish a couple of other fixes 
before I package them up. ) 


The lines commented with /* sdm7g */ are the added code.

There is another definition of chdir right above this one, wrapped
in a "#ifdef DODO" clause -- with no DODO's defined, apparently. 
Is this old bypassed code, or is there a case for DODO ?

Well -- I swear it REALLY  worked when I first tested it!

It stopped working when I added an additional error test, and
I can't seem to get it to work for me again. 

Maybe there is some additional magic about those low globals --
they are globals afterall -- that lets them work in one 
case and not another.  

I'll just sit here and quietly grumble till I figure it out.

No, this is not the case. Because in the Mac version 
the situation is not changed even if we use the 'free-color'

(setf w (send graph-window-proto :new))
(send w :use-color t)

(make-color 'my-color 1 1 0)
(send w :draw-color 'my-color)
(send w :draw-line 50 50 100 100)

(free-color 'my-color)
(make-color 'my-color 1 0 1)
(send w :draw-color 'my-color)
(send w :draw-line 100 50 50 100)


But I finally I found that if I issued 'free-color' and then
dragged the Graph Window by the mouse to anothe place
and the use 'make-color', then it resuted in success in changing
the color.

(make-color 'my-color 1 1 0)
(send w :draw-color 'my-color)
(send w :draw-line 50 50 100 100)

(free-color 'my-color)
;;;; draggin the Graph Window by the mouse to another place
(make-color 'my-color 1 0 1)
(send w :draw-color 'my-color)
(send w :draw-line 100 50 50 100)

Be sure that draggin the window before issuing the 'free-color'
results in failure.

Do you imagine this?  It seems that 'free-color does not work properly.

Just a note of support saying that there's at least one of us out here who

I'm not sure what the purpose of this functionality is. (I admit that
for certain purposes, especially designing student exercises, it would
be very useful to have this under programatic control.) 

On the other hand, there is a rather nice shareware utility called
Default Folder which I've been using for about a month now which
adds a menu of the 10 most recently accessed directories to the open
dialog.  This might solve most of the problem you are having with the
open dialogs, it will also work with applications other than
xlisp-stat.  I've been using for about a month without any problems
attirbutable to it.

It should be available from all the usual sources for Mac Shareware (I
think I got if from the MacUser archive on zdnet).

OK - expressing the problem as it's stated in the subject line is 
just an artifact of a unix programmer trying to grapple with Mac-isms:
"Why doesn't it work the way it's supposed to?" 

The real problem isn't tracking - it's that I need to manage 
different sets of defaults -- a default directory for user input data,
a default directory for reference files used in fitting the data,
a default directory for output & results, a default or three for
loading new program modules. The latter is the only one where it
makes sense to bypass the standard file dialogs and load directly
by name.

Thanks -- I'll take a look at this. It doesn't sound as if it will
do what I want for *THIS* case, but it would sure be nice to use 
when programming in LispStat.

The reason I would like it is so that I can have dialogs open to default
directories. This works under windows and unix, but the argument that tells
the open dialog when to open doesn't work under MacOS. This is especially
true for naive folks such as students who may not know how to navigate
arround the directory structure.

This is true (I use now utilities super-boomerang to do this). But it would
still be really nice to be able to tell the open dialog to open at a
specified point in the directory hierarchy.

Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk

I discovered (when some previously functioning code began to misbehave) that
inverse in xlisp-stat 2.1 Release 3.47 fails to invert a 1x1 matrix; for
example:

   > (inverse (matrix '(1 1) '(1)))
   Error: incompatible with access indices - #(0)
   Happened in: #<Byte-Code-Closure: #7f8d04>

This works just fine in the previous version that I was using, Release 3.44:

   > (inverse (matrix '(1 1) '(1)))
   #2A((1.0))

I'm running the 32-bit Windows version under Windows 95.

Tat definitely looks like a bug. I'll see if I can reproduce it and

Hi XlispStatters,

Apologies to those outside the UK, but this is really addressedto UK
statisticians who write code in XlispStat.

The Royal Statistical Society Statistical Computing Section is keen to
have a meeting on Object Oriented Programming, and as wondering if there
is anyone who has some interesting examples of work that they have been
doing in XlispStat that they would be willing to talk about in London
in March.  Reasonable expenses would be paid, but I am afraid only for
travel within the UK.

Anyone interested, let me know ASAP.

Thanks
James

One of the concerns I've always had with XLS is its inability to
handle missing values.  For example, I'm fitting a logistic model
to the byssinosis data from Lindsey's "Modeling Frequency and Count
Data" which has 5 factors and a binomial response r, n for each
combination.  Seven of the combinations have no data.  When I try to
fit the model I get an error because of the zeros.
  To fix this, I simply deleted the guilty observations and everything
fit fine.  But, it was tedious to do this by hand.  My question is how
does one delete the 31st, 34th, 41st, etc observations from each of the
5 variables and the responses at the same time.  What would be really
nice would be to have a function that identified the observations that
had 0 n, and deleted those from all the variables.  Any thoughts?

And BTW what is the difference between (def x) and (defvar x)?

As always, thanks!!

I have noticed the following strangness in the Mac 3.44 version of XLS. It
looks like the binomial-dens and poisson-dens functions are unbound, but if
I do an apropos for them they seem to be there. Here's the listener:

Error: The function BINOMIAL-DENS is unbound.

How can this be? And where did the density functions go to? Is this really

This is just a documentation bug. Binomials and poissons do not have
densities, thus the functions are called binomial-pmf and poisson-pmf.

Note that the attempt to call the non-existent functions, has the
unintended side-effect of creating symbols with those names, which
then show up when "apropos" is called.  I've run into this bit of
confusion before, when hunting for the name of a function I can't
recall.

It would be nice if missing-data capabilities were built into lisp-stat, but
it's not to hard to do this kind of thing.  Here's a simple function that
gets rid of missing data in a list of variables. I'm sure that someone else
could program this more elegantly.

(defun delete-missing (variables &key (miss '?) (test #'equal))
"Args: (variables &key (miss '?) (test #'equal))
VARIABLES is a list of sequences, containing the variables; MISS gives the
missing data code (default '?); TEST gives the equality test (default
#'equal). The function returns a list a sequences containing only
observations with valid data for all variables.
Example: (delete-missing (list x y z) :miss '*)"
  (let* ((bad (remove-duplicates 
               (combine (mapcar 
                         #'(lambda (x) (which (map-elements test miss x)))
                         variables))))
         (all (iseq (length (first variables))))
         (good (sort-data (set-difference all bad))))
    (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (select x good)) variables)))


>And BTW what is the difference between (def x) and (defvar x)?
>

Def defines variables that are lexically scoped (the default in lisp);
defvar defined variables that are dynamically scoped. Here's a lisp-stat
dialog that illustrates the difference:

> (defvar x 2)
X
> (def y 1)
Y
> (defun f (x) (g))
F
> (defun g () x)
G
2
> (f 3)
3
> (defun h (y) (i))
H
> (defun i () y)
I
> (i)
1
> (h 3)
1

So, calling g from f shadows the global value of the dynamically scoped
variable x, but calling i from h doesn't shadow the global value of y
because y is a lexically scoped variable defined in the global environment
(or something like that).

I hope that this helps,
 John

I've used XLS #.NOT-A-NUMBER to encode missing values. 

I don't know if that and the POSITYVE and NEGATIVE-INFINITY
values are supported on all platforms or just where there is
existing IEEE FP support. It is on the Mac. ( 3.47 )

I also often use a reciprocal function, that doesn't give an
error on divide by zero, but yields infinity. I had qualms 
about just changing the bahaviour of '/' : I find that typically,
a divide by zero of a single number is usually an error I 
want to catch, but something of the form ( / 1 vector ) I
usually expect to pass, zeros or not. 

Much better than just using an arbitrary large number.

You can also modify the :adjust-to-data methods to take this
into account so that the graph functions don't bother to
include those asymptotic or missing values in scaling the
graph to the window.

The normal distribution, regression, and measures of central
tendency pages in the textbook have been updated. Also, quite
a bit of introductory textual material has been added. There
are new Xlisp-Stat demos to illustrate the variational
characterization of mean and median.

The easiest way to find these is to go to 

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/textbook

and then hit the [What's New] button.

Subject: Bug list for Release 3.47
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk

I  have discovered the following  bugs in release 3.47 while coding a
project.  Wouldn't it be a good idea if there was a generally available
list of bugs that users have found, so that we don't all keep rediscovering
the same ones?  Perhaps a web page at the UCLA site?

[NB1:  I don't think that LispStat is particularly buggy - quite the
contrary (especially as 3.47 is supposed to be an Alpha version!)]
[NB2: Some of the following may be bugs in my understanding, rather than in
code; if so, let me know].
[NB3: Some of these bugs have been reported previously to stat-lisp-news]


1.  The function 'plot-points'  fails to plot any points if the
y-coordinates of all the points are identical.
EXAMPLE:  (plot-points '(1 2 3 4 5 6) '(3 3 3 3 3 3))

2. equalp does not regard two equivalent structures as equal
EXAMPLE:
> (defstruct p x y)
P
> (setq a (make-p :x 1 :y 2))
#S(P X 1 Y 2)
> (setq b (make-p :x 1 :y 2))
#S(P X 1 Y 2)
> (equalp a b)
NIL
>

3. A DEFSTRUCT print-function will not work with a lambda expression.  It will
however work with a named function.
EXAMPLE:
> (defstruct (node (:print-function
                                 (lambda (n s d)
                                   (format s "#<~A>" (node-elt n)))))
                   elt (l nil) (r nil))

> (setq a-node (make-node :elt 'X ))
Error: bad function - #<Unknown: #7a0300>
Happened in: #<Unknown: #7a0300>
> a-node
Error: bad function - #<Unknown: #7a0300>
Happened in: #<Unknown: #7a0300>

4. The Mac. version of the compiler intermittently prints voluminous
tracing information while it compiles.  I haven't been able to track down
what sets this off - it may be an uninitialised variable somewhere.  It is
harmless but irritating.


The following are not strictly bugs, but are things which could (probably)
be implemented with little extra effort:

1. (compile-file file-name) returns NIL even if the compilation was
successful (or T if the resulting file was also loaded).  CLtL2 says that
compile-file should return three values, the pathname of the compiled file,
the number of warnings plus errors, and the number of errors encountered.
These would be much more useful.

2. There is no way for a lisp program to discover the pathname of the file
to which an editing window is attached (on a Mac).  This is a shame becuase
it prevents people like me developing a more sophisticated programmer
interface than the rather bare bones default LispStat one.

I have some bugs and patches to 3.47 -- especially the Mac version, at:
<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/MacXLS/Changes.to.3.47/index.html>

I'll try to keep that info updated, however, I am only actively working
on the Mac version, so I can't (at the moment) do much testing cross
platform. ( I have access to the other platforms -- I just don't have the
time to try to keep a cross platform distribution updated and documented.)

[ I'ld be more than happy to see someone else manage the "official" 
  list and link my notes into it. ]

It *does* plot the points -- the bug must be in :ADJUST-TO-DATA. 
When I try it, the y-max is set to 1.0. If you ( SEND plot :RANGE 1 0 5 ) 
you will see the plotted points. 


[ Sorry -- that's the only one I can answer off the top of my head. 
  But I'll certainly look at your last point about Mac window pathnames,
  as that would probably be useful to me. ]

         By doing just a little every day, you can gradually 
                let the task completely overwhelm you.

Subject: Q: Looking for "color-coding" routines in XLS
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk

Hello,

probably my question in the subject isn't that clear... I'm looking
for a tool to visualize relations between multiple timeseries over
time. I imagine a grid of colored squares where the square with
coordinates (i,j) codes some relation between series i and j (for
example covariance, coherence etc.) in color. With a time-moving
window I could have a color-movie of these relationships for all
channels simulataneously and could watch for any kind of
regularities. This kind of dynamic graphics should be easy to program
in XLS. A first step would be a map from values to colors.

Has anybody done something like that and is willing to easen my job? 

Thank you very much!

The LaTeX below explains, and the Lisp at the end implements, adding three
principal axes to a spin-proto. Implemented as a method :pca, which
does not need arguments, because everything is sitting right there in
the proto.

\title{PCA of three variables in Xlisp-Stat}
\author{Jan de Leeuw}
\date{\today}
\maketitle
Suppose $u_{i}=(x_{i},y_{i},z_{i})$ are $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$.
We want to find direction cosines $w=(w_{1},w_{2},w_{3})$ and
an intercept $a=(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3})$ such that the
line $\mathcal{L}=\{y\mid y=a+\lambda w\}$ approximates the $u_{i}$
as closely as possible.\par
%
The loss function we use is
\begin{equation*}
\sigma(a,w)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\min_{\lambda_{i}}\ (u_{i}-a-\lambda_{i}w)'
(u_{i}-a-\lambda_{i}w).
\end{equation*}
This means that we project the $u_{i}$ perpendicularly on the line,
and measure the sum of squared distances of the $u_{i}$ and the
projections $\hat u_{i}$. Then choose $a$ and $w$, with $w'w=1$,
such that $\sigma(a,w)$ is minimized.\par
%
It is clear that this problem is identical to the problem of minimizing
\begin{equation*}
\sigma(a,w,\lambda)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} (u_{i}-a-\lambda_{i}w)'(u_{i}-a-\lambda_{i}w)
\end{equation*}
over all three sets of variables, with constraint $w'w=1$. This show 
that we may also require, without loss of generality, that the 
$\lambda_{i}$ sum to zero.\par
%
We first minimize of $a$ for given $w$ and $\lambda$. This gives
$\hat a=u_{\bullet},$
with superscript $\bullet$ indicating mean. Thus
\begin{equation*}
\min_{a}\ \sigma(a,w,\lambda)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\tilde u_{i}-\lambda_{i}w)'
(\tilde u_{i}-\lambda_{i}w),
\end{equation*}
with tildes over symbols indicating deviations from the mean. Now 
minimize of the $\lambda_{i}$, which must add up to
zero. The solution is $\hat\lambda_{i}=w'\tilde u_{i}$, which indeed
adds up to zero. We now find
\begin{equation*}
\min_{\lambda}\min_{a}\ \sigma(a,w,\lambda)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\{\tilde 
u_{i}'\tilde u_{i}^{}-\hat\lambda_{i}^{2}\}.
\end{equation*}
In the final step of our minimization problem, we \textit{maximize}
the sum of squares of the $\hat\lambda_{i}$ over $w$ with $w'w=1$. But
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{i=1}^{n}\hat\lambda_{i}^{2}=w'\{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\tilde u_{i}^{}
\tilde u_{i}'\}w=w'Cw,
\end{equation*}
where $C=\tilde U'\tilde U$ is the $3\times 3$ cross-product matrix of
the $\tilde u_{i}$. It follows that $\hat w$ is the normalized
eigenvector corresponding with the dominant eigenvalue of $C$, or
equivalently of the covariance matrix of the $u_{i}$. Suppose this
dominant eigenvalue is $\omega$. We then draw the line between
$\hat a-\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\omega}\hat w$ and
$\hat a+\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\omega}\hat w$, which has length $\omega$.
\par
%
This procedure can be repeated for the other two eigenvalues and
eigenvectors, that capture the other dimensions of variation. \par
%
In Xlisp-Stat we simply add a PCA method to the spin-proto. Sending
an instance of the spin-proto the PCA message will draw the three
principal axis, with squared length equal to the eigenvalues. The 
code is given below
%
%
\begin{verbatim}

(defmeth spin-proto :pca ()
(let* ((n (send self :num-points))
       (x (send self :point-coordinate 0 (iseq n)))
       (y (send self :point-coordinate 1 (iseq n)))
       (z (send self :point-coordinate 2 (iseq n)))
       (c (* (1- n) (covariance-matrix x y z)))
       (m (list (mean x) (mean y) (mean z)))
       (g (eigen c))
       (e (second g))
       (f (sqrt (first g))))
(send self :dircos m (first e) (/ (elt  f 0) 2))
(send self :dircos m (second e) (/ (elt f 1) 2))
(send self :dircos m (third e) (/ (elt f 2) 2))
(print e)
(print f)
))

(defmeth spin-proto :dircos (m w u)
	(send self :abline (+ m (* u w)) (- m (* u w)) )
)

(defmeth spin-proto :abline (a b) 
    (send self :add-lines (make-pairs a b))

If you have

(a) a Java capable browser
(b) Xlisp-Stat as a helper for the browser (i.e. lsp files are run
    locally by Xlisp-Stat)

then you can go to 

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/textbook/multivariables/pca/pca3

You will see the dvi file of a small paper, with a hyperlink. Click
the hyperlink and the dvi file will run an Xlisp-Stat program.

I think this is a nice mix.

I seem to remember the existence of a statement that will return the
successive differences and/or sums of the elements of a list.  That is
the new list will contain ((x[1]-x[0]) (x[2]-x[1])...) and similarly for
sums.  Do I remember correctly?

Thanks!

Jeff,

Difference and cumsum will do what you want. In general, apropos will find
functions whose names contain a particular symbol, so (apropos 'diff) and
(apropos 'sum) would lead you to what you need.

I don't have Dunnett's test but I do have three p-value based 
corrections (Bonferroni, Holm, and Hochberg).  Holm's test is a more 
powerful version of Bonferroni and Hochberg's test is still more 
powerful. They work well when the tests are correlated and when several 
of the null hypotheses are false (the situation when Bonferroni's 
inequality is conservative). The theory is explained in "Adjusted 
p-values for simultaneous inference" by SP Wright, Biometrics 48: 1005-1013.
Both tests multiple the smallest of k p-values by k, the next smallest by 
k-1 and so on, but they differ in the way they exploit the original 
ordering of the p-values.

Code follows:

The Lisp-Stat package comes with a file called 'inspect.lsp' in the
Examples.  I've taken this and extended it somewhat, so that it inspects
most LispStat objects and has a convenient menu interface.

I have attached below a fuller description, lifted from the source file.
I'm not including the whole file, becuase it would clutter the mail boxes
of those who are not interested in it.  But if you would like a copy to
use, or would like to provide a Web or FTP site where it can be placed,
please email me and I will send you a copy.

Happy inspecting!





;;;; inspect.lsp   version 1.3      Nigel Gilbert        December 2, 1996
;;;;
;;;; XLISP-STAT 2.1 Copyright (c) 1990, by Luke Tierney
;;;; Additions to Xlisp 2.1, Copyright (c) 1989 by David Michael Betz
;;;; You may give out copies of this software; for conditions see the file
;;;; COPYING included with this distribution.
;;;;
;;;; Based on XLISP-STAT Examples "inspect.lsp" with additional
;;;; capablity to inspect objects, closures, structures and hash tables,
;;;; a menu interface, and some bugs removed.

;;;  Usage:
;;;  -----
;;;
;;;--> using the Menu
;;;   Loading the file will add a new menu to the menu-bar, "Inspector",
;;;   with items "Inspect", "Update" and "Close all".
;;;   "Inspect" inspects whatever is selected in the front window (e.g.
;;;       to inspect the value of the variable "foo", either find the
;;;       word "foo" somewhere or type the word "foo" in a window,
;;;       select it and then type command-I or choose Inspect from
;;;       the Inspector menu).
;;;   "Update" redisplays the front Inspector window, to reflect any changes
;;;       in the value of the item being inspected (e.g. by programmatic or
;;;       command line edits 'behind the scenes')
;;;   "Close all" closes all inspector windows that are open.
;;;   The titles of all inspect windows are appended to this menu as they
;;;       are opened.
;;;   Selecting an inspector window title from the menu brings that window
;;;       to the top.
;;;
;;;--> using an Inspector window
;;;   Double clicking on any item shown in an Inspector window will
;;;       open another Inspector window to inspect that item, until
;;;       there is nothing more to inspect  (you've got down to a string
;;;       or atom)
;;;   There will often be a button marked "Edit" at the bottom of an
;;;       inspector window.  If there is, selecting an item in the window
;;;       and then pressing the Edit button allows you to change that item.
;;;       A dialogue box is displayed and you can enter the new value (which
;;;       is evaluated).
;;;
;;;--> using the Command window
;;;
;;;  (inspect data &optional (edit nil))
;;;   opens an inspect window on the value of data.  If EDIT is T, allows
;;;   editing of values of selected component items of data.
;;;   Returns the inspector object.
;;;   Double-clicking an item opens an inspect window on that item.
;;;
;;;  (close-all-inspectors)
;;;   Closes all inspector windows
;;;
;;;
;;;  Global options:
;;;  --------------
;;;    *inspect-edit*  Default editing state, T (allow edits) or NIL
;;;
;;;  Installation
;;;  ------------
;;;    1. Load this file
;;;    2. Compile it with (compile-inspect)
;;;    3. Move the file "inspect.fsl" to the Autoload directory/folder
;;;    4. Edit the file "autoload.lsp" to add the line:
;;;              (autoload inspect "inspect")
;;;    5. Then, whenever you want use the inspector, just evaluate
;;;         either  (inspect)  to load the menu
;;;         or      (inspect {data}) to inspect {data}
;;;    6. To see it working, load the inspector (see step 5) and then
;;;       evaluate
;;;                 (setq test-data (test-inspect))
;;;       then select the word "test-data" in the XLISP-STAT window
;;;       with the mouse and choose the "Inspect" item from the
;;;       Inspector menu.  Double-click on an item in the Inspect window
;;;       see its value, and so on...
;;;
;;;   Bugs
;;;   ----
;;;   Won't display the values of structure slots which have accessor
;;;   functions defined using the :con-name option in defstruct
;;;   (Because XLSIP-STAT doesn't make the names of these functions
;;;   available to the Inspector).  Works with ordinary accessors,
;;;   though.
;;;
;;;   Developed on a Macintosh with XLISP-STAT 2.1 Release 3.44 (Beta).
;;;    Not tested on other other machines
;;;

Subject: Bug: Histogram Y scale
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu

If you evaluate:

(def precipitation (list .77 1.74 .81 1.20 1.95 1.20 .47 1.43 3.37 2.20
3.00 3.09 1.51 2.10 .52 1.62 1.31 .32 .59 .81 2.81 1.87 1.18 1.35 4.75 2.48
.96 1.89 .90 2.05))
PRECIPITATION
> (setq hist (histogram precipitation))
#<Object: 45965420, prototype = HISTOGRAM-PROTO>
> (send hist :y-axis t)
(T NIL 4)

you'll get a histogram with the Y axis showing the scale (Incidentally, why
isn't this the default?  When would one want to plot a histogram and _not_
want to know what the heights of the columns represent?)

However, the scale shown is wrong!  In this specific case, the scale ranges
from 0 to 0.6, when the scale is supposed to be showing a count (the number
of observations in each bin), which clearly cannot be non-integral.   Other
examples I've tried are similarly scaled wrongly.

If you try to force the issue, by setting the range 'by hand' using

(send hist :range 1 0 10)

this is accepted, and yields a sensible scale, but any subsequent
:adjust-to-data message reverts to the wrong scale again.

Anyone any ideas about where the problem is?  I'm using release 3.47 on a Mac.

Thanks for finding out how to make hist show the Y axis.  I agree that
it would be good to make it the default.

It looks like the Y axis is showing the density scale.  If so, then it
is correct, at least according to textbooks such as Freedman et al.'s
"Statistics".

   If you evaluate:

   (def precipitation (list .77 1.74 .81 1.20 1.95 1.20 .47 1.43 3.37 2.20
   3.00 3.09 1.51 2.10 .52 1.62 1.31 .32 .59 .81 2.81 1.87 1.18 1.35 4.75 2.48
   .96 1.89 .90 2.05))
   PRECIPITATION
   > (setq hist (histogram precipitation))
   #<Object: 45965420, prototype = HISTOGRAM-PROTO>
   > (send hist :y-axis t)
   (T NIL 4)

   you'll get a histogram with the Y axis showing the scale (Incidentally, why
   isn't this the default?  When would one want to plot a histogram and _not_
   want to know what the heights of the columns represent?)

   However, the scale shown is wrong!  In this specific case, the scale ranges
   from 0 to 0.6, when the scale is supposed to be showing a count (the number
   of observations in each bin), which clearly cannot be non-integral.   Other
   examples I've tried are similarly scaled wrongly.

   If you try to force the issue, by setting the range 'by hand' using

   (send hist :range 1 0 10)

   this is accepted, and yields a sensible scale, but any subsequent
   :adjust-to-data message reverts to the wrong scale again.

   Anyone any ideas about where the problem is?  I'm using release 3.47 on a Mac.

My preference is to have no axis as the default, though it would be
better if that could be changed easily. Threason I like no axis is
that it is the shape that counts, not the normalization. Different
people like different normalizations and get confused if the one used
doesn't suit their preference. The reason I chose the density scale as
the underlying internal scale is to make superposition of densities
easy.

Before I start plowing through the GNUPLOT manual, has anyone had 
success with producing nice graphics with gnuplot.lsp in a MS Windows
environment?  I would like to be able to cut and paste publication
quality graphs into a MS Word document.

TIA!

What's gnuplot.lsp if I might ask?  I use gnuplot from lisp (gcl) all
the time (under Unix) and find that it's HORRIBLE as a call-out
application.  If anyone can suggest a better call-out plotting package
than gnuplot, I (and probably many others) would be in your eternal
debt. (Or, at least for a couple of years, anyhow. :)

gnuplot-lsp is a hack made by jan deleeuw anf myself to make easier to 
call gnuplot from xlisp-stat graphical objects. I agree with you about 
that HORRIBLE interface but I think thah gnuplot 2.6 has done a giant 
step to avoid that. Anyone with experience in that arena?

Hmmm.  Wel, I think that 3.5 is the latest version, which is what I'm
running, and it still bytes.

Bernhard Walter wrote a method to export figures derived from graph-proto 
to XFIG 3.1. XFIG is an interactive, menu driven graphic package available 
for Unix machines. I think the file "xlisp.lsp" should be available on 
the stat-lisp server.

Subject: Spin-proto in Windows Lisp-stat
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk

Having developed a program using Release 3.47 on a Mac, I wanted to
demonstrate it at a meeting where there is only a Windows 95 PC with a LCD
tablet.  However, when I tried to run the program using the Win32 version
of Lisp-Stat, I find that the spin-proto code fails in graph-overlay-proto.
Even evaluating

(setq p (send spin-proto :new 3))

in a clean image at the top level fails.

Has anyone tripped over this before and found the bug?  I need an answer
within the next few hours if I am to get the demo to work in time  -
otherwise it's back to transparencies of screenshots for the talk!

Many thanks.

In X11graph.c:StWSetSize change

    adjust_scroll_bars(gwinfo, TRUE);

to

    if (gwinfo != NULL) adjust_scroll_bars(gwinfo, TRUE);

That should cure the core dump. The end result probably won't be all
that satisfying though -- the dialogs don't know how to adjust
themselves to a new size.

Hello, Netters.

	Is there any ftp site that I can download XLISP-STAT binary code  for
Linux?  5 years ago, when I was still a ph.d. student in MPLS, I
download the source code from School of Statistics, UMN and compiled on
a Linux at home.  Now I wonder if there is any binary code for linux
available that I can use on a Pentium running Linux 2.0?  Many thanks in
advance!

Best,
Harry

     Call For Entries --- Mathematical Contest in Modeling 1997


------------------------- The Basics -------------------------

   The Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM), a national contest for
college undergraduates, will hold its thirteenth competition in
February, 1997.  The MCM is designed to stimulate and improve
problem-solving and writing skills in a team setting.

   Last year, over 393 teams submitted solution papers, representing 235
schools in nine countries.  Outstanding solution papers will be
published October, 1997, in a special issue of the "The UMAP
Journal."  Previous winners have included a broad range of
colleges and outstanding secondary schools.


Contest Date and Time:

  The 1997 contest will begin at 12:01 AM local time, Friday,
February 7 and will officially end at 5:00 PM on Monday, February
10.


Registration of Teams:

  Teams must be registered in advance.  Each department may sign up
either one team of three members or two teams of three members
each.  No more than four teams may be registered from any one
institution.  Team members may be changed at the last minute
without notifying COMAP.  If a department preregisters one team,
a second team may be added, but a control number must be obtained
from COMAP before a second team can be entered.


To request a Registration Packet: 

   By mail: write to COMAP Incorporated, Suite 210, 57 Bedford Street,
                     Lexington, MA 02173-9684 USA

   By telephone: Call Clarice Callahan at 800-77-COMAP
                 (800-77-6627) or (617)-862-7878 (ext 37)

   By FAX: (617)-863-1202 

   By email: primary: mcm@comap.com
             secondary: pcolsen@super.org


REGISTRATION PACKETS MUST BE RECEIVED AT COMAP BY FRIDAY, 3
JANUARY, 1997.

Further information can be found at the following URLs.  Several of
them contain sample problems from previous years.

   http://buzzard.ups.edu/mcm.html
   http://mickey.lcsc.edu/~sas/ns/news/mathteam


Sponsorship:

   Major funding for the Mathematical Contest in Modeling is
provided by the National Security Agency.  Mathematics is of
central importance to the mission of the National Security
Agency, an agency of the Department of Defense. NSA proudly
supports numerous mathematics education and research activities
such as the MCM 

   Additional support for this project is provided by:
   The Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences,
   The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and
   The Mathematical Association of America.


------------------------------- More Details -----------------------

The Two Problems:

   Each team will choose one of two problems.  Sample problems
are available from the URLs listed above or from
pcolsen@super.org.  After the envelope containing the contest
problem is opened, the team may not discuss any aspect of the
problem with the advisor or anyone else.

   The competition intends to allow participants to use all
information that is currently available, but to disqualify any
teams that discuss the problems with people in a position to
supply them with information reflecting experience or
professional expertise.  The relevant issue is one of intent;
each team is expected to develop all of its substantive analysis
without the help of others.

   Participants may use computers, software packages,
libraries, or any other inanimate sources.  The MCM packet will
provide requirements and suggested procedures.  Problems tend to
be open-ended and are unlikely to have a unique solution.
Attention must be paid to clarity, analysis, and design in
attempting a solution.  The narrative part of the solution papers
must be typed and in English.  Partial solutions are
acceptable. Two copies of each paper must be submitted.

   Student teams are to complete all work in English by 5:00 PM
on Monday, February 10, 1997.  Faculty advisors must ensure that
no alterations of any type are made after the 5:00 PM cutoff,
and that papers are received at COMAP by Friday, February 14.
Papers mailed from other than the continental United States
follow the same procedures, but have until Monday, February 17 to
arrive at COMAP.


Foreign Entries:

   Students must submit their work in English.  No work is to be
done after 5:00 PM on Monday, February 10.  In order to assure
timely judging, no additional time is provided for translation
apart from the contest.


MCM Results:

   Judging will take place three weeks after the contest.  The
solutions will be recognized as Successful Participants,
Honorable Mention, Meritorious, or Outstanding.

   Advisors and teams will be notified of the results in April,
1997.  News releases will be prepared and there will be
announcements in college and professional publications.


Recognition:

   All successful participants will receive a certificate.
Outstanding teams will receive bronze plaques and their solution
papers will be published in The UMAP Journal.


Prizes:

   The Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences
(INFORMS) will designate one Outstanding team for each problem as
an INFORMS winner, and will award cash prizes to each team.  In
addition, INFORMS will give free memberships to all Meritorious
teams.

   The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) will
designate one Outstanding team for each problem as a SIAM winner.
Each SIAM winning team will receive a certificate, a cash prize,
and partial expenses for a trim to the SIAM annual meeting.

I've been working with a dataset in which missing data are encoded as
not-a-number and encountered what seems to me strange behaviour for tests of
equality:

> (equal not-a-number 9.1)
T
> (equal not-a-number 9.)
NIL
> (equal not-a-number 9)
NIL
> (equalp not-a-number 9.1)
T
> (eql not-a-number 9.1)
T
> (eq not-a-number 9.1)
NIL
> (= not-a-number 9.1)
T

That is, all of the equality predicates seem to distinguish between NAN and
integers (including integer reals), but only eq distinguishes between NAN
and a real number.

Although I can use eq to get what I want, I found all this pretty confusing.
Does this behaviour conform to the common lisp standard?

Subject: Q: XLS and SAPA
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk

Hi all,

I would like to ask for some hints and advice concerning the use of
the SAPA package within XLISP-STAT (3-44):

- Compiling: I got everything to compile without problems. However,
when loading the compiled files, XLS complains about "multf not
defined" (or similar, I forgot). The "define-modify-macro" function
used in utilities.lsp to define the multf macro does not exist in XLS,
but this doesn't trigger even a warning by the compiler. Replacing the
(define-modify-macro call by a (defmacro similar to incf in common.lsp
solves this problem.
Q: why does the compiler not complain about "define-modify-macro"?
(Maybe beginner's LISP question...)

- The compiled code does not run. First there are name conflicts:
> (in-package :CL-USER)
#<Package USER>
> (use-package :SAPA)
Name conflict of SAPA:ACVS and ACVS
  when using #<Package SAPA> in #<Package USER>
Name conflict of SAPA:INTERQUARTILE-RANGE and INTERQUARTILE-RANGE
  when using #<Package SAPA> in #<Package USER>
Name conflict of SAPA:DIFFERENCE and DIFFERENCE
  when using #<Package SAPA> in #<Package USER>
Name conflict of SAPA:QUANTILE-PLOT and QUANTILE-PLOT
  when using #<Package SAPA> in #<Package USER>
Error: name conflicts

Ok, SAPA is designed for CL systems and needs to defun a lot of things
XLS already has. 
Q: Is there a "downsized" SAPA package for XLS with the functionally
doubly defined code replaced by calls to XLS functions?

Q: ACVS seems to be defined in USER, but no help is available, the
function ACVS is unboud, the variable ACVS is unbound. What is
USER::ACVS? 

Second problem with the compiled code: if I call, say 
(sapa:acvs some-vector), I get
Error: too few arguments
??? there is only one required argument to acvs ???

- Without compiler:
The name conflicts remain. Didn't expect otherwise.

(sapa:acvs some-vector) seems to work correctly. Two "Warning: special
declarations are not supported", but nothing else.
Q: What can go wrong with the unsupported special declaration? Could
simply ignoring the warning introduce spurious results? 

General question: could you recommand going "alpha", i.e. upgrading to
3-47? (I'm on SPARC Solaris 2.5) Could upgrading help in the problems
above?

Thank's a lot for any hints!

See

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/archive/xlispstat/systems/macintosh/cw10/

This has two files

-rw-r--r--   1 deleeuw  faculty   1029434 Dec 18 16:28 my-xlisp-stat.sit.hqx
-rw-r--r--   1 deleeuw  faculty   1808240 Dec 18 16:22 xlisp-mac.sit.hqx

The largest one is a CodeWarrior 10 project file for building Xlisp-Stat,
together with all the necessary code (some minor changes were necessary
since Apple mucked with the universal headers again). The project file
is set for PowerPC, 604 instruction scheduling, speed optimized at level 4.
Minimum heap at 5MB, preferred heap at 10MB, stack at 256K. But all
that is easily adjusted. All the code is in one large segment, which you
would have to change for a 68K version.

The smallest one has the Xlisp-Stat binary for the Mac from this project,
plus a workspace file with compiler and help preloaded, plus a 
statinit.lsp which automatically loads inspector.fsl and compile-menu.fsl
(which I like a lot), plus a preferences file with some set-ups.

I have had no bombs with this one, I am using this as my personal
version. It is Xlisp-Stat 3.47, by the way.

Hi LispStaters:

I am trying to figure out how to control the size of the font used in
graphics windows under X11.

What I know is:
1) In appendix B of the Lisp-Stat book (p 365) Luke says: "You can specify
alternate fonts ... by using the X11 resource management facilities.
Resources controling appearance ... (include) xlisp*graph*font"
2) In "XLISP-STAT 2.1 Release 3 Beta Release Notes", dated September 19,
1994 (p. 5) Luke also says: "Upon startup of the X11 version ... the system
merges resources found in file /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Xlisp then ones
found in the file Xlisp in the directory named by the environment variable
XAPPLRESDIR, and finally the resources of the display. Resources can thus
be specified in all three places, with the display's resources having
highest precedence."

So, from this I assume that I would specify the xlisp*graph*font resource
in one of those three place (probably in the resources for the display).
What I don't know is how to do this so that font size comes out as I wish.

Can anyone help?  Thanks ...

Dunno about this one, but the distribution for stat-lisp-news got
interrupted without any symptoms.  Now fixed.

Since that time, four messages have been received but may not have been
distributed to the list.  The next four messages will be copies from the
archives.  If you've seen them already, my apologies of sending them
again.  On the other hand, if you do respond to them, please note the
email address as the forwarding won't preserve them for automatic
replies if you email directly back to the sender.

Thanks for the report of a potential problem.  Got it fixed quickly once
it was spotted!

See

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/archive/xlispstat/systems/macintosh/cw10/

This has two files

-rw-r--r--   1 deleeuw  faculty   1029434 Dec 18 16:28 my-xlisp-stat.sit.hqx
-rw-r--r--   1 deleeuw  faculty   1808240 Dec 18 16:22 xlisp-mac.sit.hqx

The largest one is a CodeWarrior 10 project file for building Xlisp-Stat,
together with all the necessary code (some minor changes were necessary
since Apple mucked with the universal headers again). The project file
is set for PowerPC, 604 instruction scheduling, speed optimized at level 4.
Minimum heap at 5MB, preferred heap at 10MB, stack at 256K. But all
that is easily adjusted. All the code is in one large segment, which you
would have to change for a 68K version.

The smallest one has the Xlisp-Stat binary for the Mac from this project,
plus a workspace file with compiler and help preloaded, plus a 
statinit.lsp which automatically loads inspector.fsl and compile-menu.fsl
(which I like a lot), plus a preferences file with some set-ups.

I have had no bombs with this one, I am using this as my personal
version. It is Xlisp-Stat 3.47, by the way.

Subject: Unix Fonts

Hi LispStaters:

I am trying to figure out how to control the size of the font used in
graphics windows under X11.

What I know is:
1) In appendix B of the Lisp-Stat book (p 365) Luke says: "You can specify
alternate fonts ... by using the X11 resource management facilities.
Resources controling appearance ... (include) xlisp*graph*font"
2) In "XLISP-STAT 2.1 Release 3 Beta Release Notes", dated September 19,
1994 (p. 5) Luke also says: "Upon startup of the X11 version ... the system
merges resources found in file /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Xlisp then ones
found in the file Xlisp in the directory named by the environment variable
XAPPLRESDIR, and finally the resources of the display. Resources can thus
be specified in all three places, with the display's resources having
highest precedence."

So, from this I assume that I would specify the xlisp*graph*font resource
in one of those three place (probably in the resources for the display).
What I don't know is how to do this so that font size comes out as I wish.

Can anyone help?  Thanks ...

I don't know how you would change the fonts xlispstat uses "on the fly";
maybe someone else can suggest the way?

You can choose the font you want for the xterm in which xlispstat is
running in the usual way for xterm by starting a new xterm with that font.
For instance,

   xterm -fn 9x15bold -e xlispstst &
   xterm -fn 12x24 -e xlispstst &

give two different fonts. The font names used here ("9x15bold", "12x24")
are among those found in /usr/X11/lib/fonts/misc/fonts.dir on my system;
other font directories under .../fonts offer a range of other
possibilities.

However, the font set in this way only applies to the window in which
xlispstat is running (its "system window", to which it sends its messages)
and not to the windows started up by xlispstat itself (e.g. if you run
"tourdemo.lsp" from the Examples directory:

   xterm -fn 12x24 -e xlispstst tourdemo.lsp &

the primary xterm will be in 12x24 but the font shown in the plot window
will be the same, "9x15", as it always is, regardless of the xterm font).

The xlisp binary contains a number of font-related strings:
   XCreateFontCursor
   XUnloadFont
   XLoadQueryFont
   XSetFont
   xlisp.graph.font
   xlisp.font
   fixed
   xlisp.menu.font
   9x15
   xlisp.dialog.font

and maybe there are xlisp[stat] commands which can manipulate these. The
README file has a few (but barely sufficient) relevant words:

**                          X11 FEATURES/BUGS
**
** Under X11 where plots and modeless dialogs show up on your screen, and
** how large they end up being, is up to the window manager. Requests you
** make may be honored under one manager but not under another.
**
** Several options can be set using the X11 resource management
** facilities.  Options controlling appearance are
**
** xlisp*menu*titles:     on for a title on a menu, off otherwise
** xlisp*menu*font:
** xlisp*dialog*font:
** xlisp*graph*font:

and, indeed, if you put into /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Xlisp a line which
says

   xlisp*graph*font:	12x24

(using a TAB for the spacing) you will see your graphs annotated in the
12x24 font. However, this is global and for all runs: I am still wondering
how you change this on-the-fly for (say) different graphs in the same run.

Happy New Year to all,
Ted.                                    (Ted.Harding@nessie.mcc.ac.uk)

The following version of chdir is a slight modification of the
one in  the file dirent.c in the mac xlispstat3.47 distribution. 

This version will set the low memory global to allow ( if you
have the right option set in the General Control panel ) 
the get|set file-dialog starting directory to track the directory
set by (set-working-directory path).


I read thru the Inside Mac doc's and Mac Programmer's FAQ once 
more and discovered that a more complicated hack is only supposed
to be required in the case that you want the directory to be 
manually settable no matter what the control panel settings. 
The simple version using LMSetSFSaveDisk and LMSetCurDirStore
*should* work if the control panel allows application to set
the directory. 

However, this only seems to work if I set the directory and not
the volume. If you uncomment the line:

   /*	LMSetSFSaveDisk( -vRefNum );	/* sdm7g */

it ceases to work.  --  I'm a bit puzzled by this behaviour! 


[ I have problems using set-working-directory  across volumes, but
  there were problems with that before -- I don't think it's any 
  different. ]

I seem to recall seeing a message about formating floating point numbers
using *float-format*.  The number of digits to the right of the decimal
can be specified.  Does anyone recall or know how to do this?

I had quite a few problems mastering the intricacies of Lisp 
Packages -- particularly when they involve using packages to
redefine and shadow existing functions, until I discovered
( in CLtL1 ) the mnemonic "Put in seven extremely random 
interface commands" - which corresponds to the  sequence:
	Provide
	IN-package
	Shadow
	EXport
	Require
	USE-package
	Import
	Commands==Contents of package/module

Which is the order you (mostly) have to use those statements to
be able to Require your package without tripping over any name
clashes. ( Actually, I've been sticking "Provide" at the *end*
of my packages so that if it is provided, that indicates that 
it did load successfully. That shouldn't make any difference with
a well tested module, but it helps with something that I'm 
interactively editing and testing. If PROVIDE executes and *then* 
the module bombs out, I have to manually LOAD the module before
reloading the module which REQUIREd it. ) 


That technique has mostly worked for me, however, I have still 
seen some dependencies on the order in which my modules are 
loaded. I ignored or worked around most of these glitches until
I was trying to compile some of the more finished modules and 
save them into my workspace. 

I found that some of the name clashes had to do with using a 
symbol in a non defining position, such as an argument list. 

These problems were with XlispStat 3.47 ( for the Macintosh ). 
Since Xlisp is not quite Common Lisp -- it includes a lot of
functions for Common Lisp compatibility, but things like packages
and symbol binding are where I would suspect the most compatibility
problems -- I also tried simulating a similar case in KCL ( the 
particular code where I noticed the problem had too many XlispStat
and intermodule dependencies for me to easily load that code ),
and I get a similar error. 


The two sessions below both generate errors from a name conflict
on the symbol 'SEQ. In both, SEQ is defined and exported in 
package "X". In the first case, #'SEQ is used in a definition
before the ( USE-PACKAGE "X" ) statement. In the second, SEQ
is merely used in the argument list in defining another function. 
 This is basically the same cases that are generating my errors
in XlispStat, although the exact error message is slight different.
It's basically the same error. On both systems, ( FIND-SYMBOL "SEQ" )
returns NIL before the use of the symbol in the USER package, and
returns the values SEQ, :INTERNAL after it's use. 
( The only significant difference I've noticed is that in some cases,
  the symbol XlispStat complains about is :SEQ -- presumably in the
  keyword package, even thought the string ":SEQ" is never used in 
  my code. ) 


 *  Am I doing something wrong here ? 

 *  Is this error normal Lisp behavior for other implementations 
    or is this behavior according to Common Lisp standard ?

      is pretty extreme! ) 
    I have been finding Lisp packages a horribly intricate maze

    yet tried to do anything complex in Java, so I can't contrast
    its packages. ) ]

When the USER package uses the package X, all the exported symbols, only
X::SEQ here, are visible to the user package without needing an explicit
package prefix.  Since there is already a USER::SEQ symbol, the unprefixed
symbol, SEQ, is ambiguous.

You should first define the X package and then the packages that will use
it.  Something like:

(make-package "X")
(export 'X::SEQ)
(defun seq ...)

(in-package "USER")
(use-package "X")

(defun a ...)

The CLTL2 way is to use DEFPACKAGE that lets you define the package in one form.

Is there a code walker ( walk-form ) version that works with Xlisp? I'm
trying to look into the feasability of porting some Common Lisp code (Common
Music) to XLISP-STAT, but it does use  "walk-form" for some things. 

A related question having to do with porting Common Lisp code: Is the
closette implementation of CLOS that's in the archives, as complete as PCL?
If not, then not what is it missing?

  Music) to XLISP-STAT, but it does use  "walk-form" for some things. 

I don't think walk-form is a standard Common-Lisp function.  (It
certainly doesn't appear in the Second Edition of Steele).  It must
either be defined somewhere in the Common Music code or in a specific
implementation.  

  A related question having to do with porting Common Lisp code: Is the
  closette implementation of CLOS that's in the archives, as complete as PCL?
  If not, then not what is it missing?

No, closette is a mini implementation of CLOS which is used in the Art
of the Meta-Object protocol to illustrate the ideas.  It is hard to
say what does and does not work.  PCL was a complete implementation of
the then proposed CLOS, but the standard changed and I don't think the
work necessary to bring PCL up to standard has ever been done (I could
be wrong here).  I never managed to get Graphical-Belief compiled
using PCL (it currently runs under Allegro CL).

Good Luck.

I eventually found this proscription to be useless.  First, as you
note, provide needs to come at the end of the file not the begining.  

Second, I found it was much more useful to have a single package
definition file for each package I created.  (In most of my code a
package corresponds to a directory and it has a file "package.lisp"
which contains its package definition).  Thus, I can load all the
package information without loading all of the functions (this is
often useful for letting the program know where dependencies will
lie).

Third, I carefully graph dependencies between packages and load the
corresponding packages in the required order.  Thus, if the
"DISTRIBUTIONS" package uses symbols from the "PARAMETERS" package, I
make sure I load that one first.  If at all possible, you package
dependencies should form an Acyclic Directed Graph.

Fourth, I rely on defpackage rather than the Seven Random Functions.
(There is a public domain version of Defpackage kicking around the
net.  I can try and dig it out if people are interested.)

Fifth, I try to avoid explicit dependencies on packages, but rather
refer to them with package qualified symbols.  Thus X:SEQ as opposed
to SEQ (with an implicit use-package above defining the dependency).
There are some exceptions, but usually this works.  

Hope this helps.

Hi Lispers:

I am preparing to publically serve Lisp-Stat applets from my site and am
wondering if anyone has experience doing this. (I've been doing this
privately for a while).

I recall that Jan did something like this but remember that he set up his
site as a Lisp-Stat provider (users would net into his site which would
then do the computations on his remote machine), whereas I plan to set up
mine as a server (users would net into my site, download code onto their
local machine, which then does the computations locally).

Do I recall correctly?

I plan on using "application/xlispstat" as the mime-type unless someone
else is already using a different mime-type. Anyone out there already doing
this? Is there an already existing mime-type for this?

Forrest

Yes and no.  Both local and remote things are done there.  In
particular, from my .mailcap file (personal mime configuration): 

	## Statistical information, PSU/AJR style
	application/x-stat-xlisp;  xlispstat.wrap %s

	## Statistical information, UCLA style.
	application/x-lisp;        xlispstat.wrap %s

where xlispstat.wrap is just a script set up to preview the code
before dumping it into xlispstat (I'm slightly paranoid about my
account).

See above.  Technically, you should use x-xlispstat, to be RFC-XXXX (I
forget which) compliant, since it isn't a mandated mime type.  I
prefer something like:
	x-stat-<PROGRAM NAME>   

to denote that the information is statistical in nature (with program
name being R, or xlisp (short for xlispstat), etc.

In the long run, it will matter, which is why I was a bit annoyed at
Jan for choosing "x-lisp" after we'd set up "x-stat-xlisp" at Penn
State long ago, but it also isn't really important -- just another
line to the mime types (or .mailcap, if you use Unix and customize
things yourself).

I believe that Iowa State Stats uses yet another mime type, but I
never did add it to my list, sorry...  If anyone else knows of people
doing this as well (besides me at Penn State/South Carolina, UCLA,
Iowa State, etc), I'd be interested in hearing about it.

best,

I use the mime type Anthony Rossini chose,

application/x-stat-xlisp

On our server, files with the .xlsp extension are served up with this
mime type.

Well -- I am not so sure about the "after" in there. But this shows
again that if you are annoyed, you should let the person know what
you are annoyed with. Actually, it is a very good idea to change
to x-stat-xlisp for scripts that are supposed to execute on the
clients. I now have the problem that if I try to download a foo.lsp
file from the archive, it will execute, so I have to do something
anyway. I'll change matters up here, according to the Tony/Luke
rules.

Let's agree on

foo.xlsp gets mime type "x-stat-xlisp" and (on our clients) gets executed
foo.lsp  gets mime type "x-lisp"       and (on our clients) gets downloaded

This means the scripts in the UCLA Textbook and Toolbox
will change to foo.xlsp, and it means that people wanting
to use this need to change their mimecaps (which means
that they configure netscape appropriately).

I'll put instructions in appropriate places, and I'll add
icons for foo.lsp and foo.xlsp to our Apache servers.

An answer for Forrest: this is the way most of our stuff works. But there
are quite a few others which use xlispstat via CGI (i.e. the program
executes on the server). This is done for the power calculator, the
regression calculator, and the Xlisp-Stat interface in

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/cgi-bin/Xlisp-Stat.cgi

The CGI programs are all written in C and they use popen/fork/pipe to
start the appropriate xlispstat processes. The Xlisp-Stat interface
forks a special version of Xlisp-Stat with system etc disabled.

Since we recently changed both the machine and the httpd server for
www.stat.ucla.edu, there will be some things that are broken at the
moment.

I am interested in writing an application where we will import an text
file containing a column of concentrations and a column of responses. 
We will perform one-way anovas on datasets but don't 
want to force the user into a given type of format so need to get the
columns into a matrix and sort the rows according to one of the
columns.  How does one sort the responses by the concentrations?  I
want to be able to do Dunnett's test on each concentration vs. a
control.  I've asked about XLS code for Dunnett's test before, but
no one seemed to have it.  I'm not much of a programmer so if anyone
would like take this on as a project I'd sure like it :>)

Thanks for any help!

I probably should've emphasized "was", Jan.  And, I might be wrong
about the time frame (since they were both worked on around the same
time).  However, I overgrew (SOME OF) my childishness 1-2 years ago
:-), and really don't care one way or another now.

The name for the mime type really isn't important as long as people
are aware of what they are, where they are...

In fact, I sort of like the idea of x-xlispstat version, these days.
x-stat-xlisp would only make sense if more people used x-stat-R or
x-stat-sas as client side helpers, for example... (then we get into
the grand unification theory argument :-).

BTW, one of the things I've been considering is construction of an
XLispStat (and/or R) Plug-in for Netscape, using the SDK.  The code
would be a bit strange, since ideally there would be a base "SDK"
device which did the appropriate things on all three platforms?  Has
anyone done much more than just go over the Netscape SDK specs and jot
down some of the needed additions to the code (i.e. studied the
routing of listener IO and graphics devices, etc?)

So Lispers:

Do we have an emerged (emerging) standard, as proposed by Jan?

>foo.xlsp gets mime type "x-stat-xlisp" and (on our clients) gets executed
>foo.lsp  gets mime type "x-lisp"       and (on our clients) gets downloaded

The only problem I can see with this is that windoze based servers can't
deal with .xlxp extensions.

Either we agree there's not enough of them to matter, or we might go with
foo.xls for client executable files.

I think I prefer foo.xls, if it doesn't mean too much reworking on other
folks parts.

Any thoughts?

You might be able to do this with the ViSta extension of lispstat that I've
developed.

ViSta will read in text files of data where each line contains an
observation (a concentration and a response). These are converted to ViSta
data objects.

It can sort observations into order so that all levels of a concentration
are in adjacent records.

It can perform one-way anova, but it must be a balanced design. So, this is
a potential problem.

It can't do a Dunnett's test.

How many observations are there in the data? (ViSta can be pretty slow for
large data).

Let me know how this sounds, and if looks possible, I'll give it a try.

I know nearly nothing about MS W95 or MS WNT, but don't they allow for
long extensions?  We can assume that MS W3.xx will go away in the next
year or 3...

yes, I too was wondering about .fsl files. I think your suggestion is the
right one.

I've no clue either about W95 or WNT (and OS/2, as well), but I'll bet your
assumption is right about W3.xx ...

Much as I could go for the idea that there aren't enough of them to
matter (even if it's millions ... ), I'm wondering if it matters anyway.
Namely, if you try giving a 4+ letter extension to DOS, it only seems to
look at the first 3 letters anyway. See the following (*.bak vs *.bake).
No doubt some experimentation would be needed to see if it mattered in the
application being discussed.

But, assuming it continues to work the same way, then anyone can call for
"foo.xlsp" and a DOS server will see "foo.xls" and execute it (it could
get more complicated if it were the "*.xlsp" files for downloading, for
then the filename that the client got would presumably try to be
"foo.xls"; but as you propose it the downloadable files have 3-letter
extensions anyway).

However, this is just a shot in the dark. Experts please judge.

Best wishes,
Ted.                                    (Ted.Harding@nessie.mcc.ac.uk)

with netscape or mimencode or whatever, xls is used for excel 
spreadsheets. Now we can collectively all wish that DOS, Windoze,
Microsoft, Bill G, and Excel did not exist, but if we want to make
Xlisp-Stat even more generally accepted than it already is, I think
we should acknowledge that the evil empire is here to stay. Thus
xls and xlsp are out, as far as I am concerned. But foo.xlisp
could be used, because msdog will truncate this to foo.xli. On the
other hand, having extensions with more than three letters is
not very elegant, I think, so why not use foo.xli right away.
Thus my current proposal is

foo.xli => application/x-xlispstat => xlispstat %s
foo.lsp => text/plain => browser handles this

See

http://www.stat.ucla.edu:7070/~deleeuw/lisp/

this is a version of apache that serves .xli and .fsl as
application/x-xlispstat

thus if your client starts Xlisp-Stat if application/x-xlispstat
is served, this should work

.lsp files are served as text/plain, so they are just displayed

also see the icons -- which are also in the Xlisp-Stat archive
if you use this server (i.e. the one on port 7070)

our basic server is not so configured yet, so if you go to

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~deleeuw/lisp/

the .xli and .fsl and .lsp files have ? icons and are all just
displayed as text

calculator.lsp is David Betz' TI-30, by the way

I have used the one-way.lsp to compare series of factors each a list or
vector, but how do I compare factors when one list contains the grouping
indicators and another list contains all the responses?  I'm am sure 
there is an easy lispish way to create the first situation from the 
second, but I don't know how.

Thanks to all for previous help on sorting a matrix.

Hi Lispers:

So it looks like the result of the first ever, International Virtual
Conference on Internet LispStat Standards ... IVCILS ;-) ... is, according
to Jan's suggestion:

foo.xli => application/x-xlispstat => xlispstat
foo.fsl => application/x-xlispstat => xlispstat
foo.lsp => text/plain => browser handles this

I'll set up my server to work this way. Ya'll do the same, hear! (as they
say in these parts) ...

I do seem to recall occasionally seeing a few extensions with more
than three letters on the web -- something like .html or .java :-)

There is a bug in the internal evalhook function code that can cause a
segment violation if a garbage collection occurs at a particular point
because a location the GC checks has not been properly initialized.
This affects both versions 3.44 and 3.47 -- it is already fixed in 3.48
which will be out in one or two weeks I hope.

To fix the bug, in the function xevalhook in the file xlbfun.c, the code

#if 0   /* old way (see below) */
    xlsave(oldenv);
    xlsave(oldfenv);
    xlsave(newenv);
#else /* TAA MOD -- see below */
    xlprotect(oldenv);
    xlprotect(oldfenv);
    xlprotect(newenv);
#endif

should be changed to

    xlsave(oldenv);
    xlsave(oldfenv);
    xlsave(newenv);

Hell-o again!  Today's problem is trying to reduce a list of values with
possibly different numbers of repeats, to a list of unique values.

to wit...
(unknow-command '(0 0 1 2 2 2 3 4 4))

should return (0 1 2 3 4)

remove-duplicates  

[note: I don't think the *ordering* of the result is guaranteed -- it
might return (0 3 2 1 4)].  It also takes an optional argument specifying
how to test for equality so that (eq, eql, equalp or something of your
choice).

But I get so much help whenever I do, and that will only

A new alpha release of xlispstat, 3.48, is now available for ftp from
ftp://ftp.stat.umn.edu/pub/xlispstat/Alpha. This release fixes a
number of bugs in the previous alpha release, 3.47, and incorporates
changes in XLISP-PLUS 3.0.

Unix sources (including code for Macintosh and MSWindows versions) and
binaries macintosh and windows binaries are provided.

Please let me know if you run into any problems. If this release is
reasonably stable, it will become the standard release in a few weeks.

Hi all,

I found a minor problem with the new 3-48 version of
xlispstat:

> (rank '(9 8 7 6 5))
Error: The function LORDER is unbound.
Happened in: #<Subr-TOP-LEVEL-LOOP: #15a2c0>

System: SunOS 5.5.1 Generic_103640-03 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-2
Installed by: configure; make; make install

BTW, I recognize with joy the moves towards BLAS et al. done since 3-44.
Great!

Johannes

I did say it was an alpha level release :-). Here is a fix:

If you are compiling from the sources change the last line in
stats.lsp from

(defun rank (x) (xlisp::make-compound x (lorder (lorder x))))

to

(defun rank (x) (xlisp::make-compound x (order (order x))))

On the mac or windows versions, the easiest fix is to

	Make a backup copy of xlisp.wks -- just to be safe

	Then in xlispstat do

		(defun rank (x) (xlisp::make-compound x (order (order x))))
		(save-workspace "xlisp.wks")

	Copy the new workspace to the startup direcory if it isn't
	already there.

Anthony Rossini raised the possibility of making a Netscape plug-in
for XLISP-STAT or R. I've been thinking about the issues for a while,
so I thought I'd write down some notes and send them out for
reactions.  This is kind of long and rambling - you know what key to
hit if you're not interested :-).

A couple of preliminaries. There is a book on plug-ins available,

	Netscape Developer's Guide to Plug-Ins, 1/e
	Doug Young, Mountain View, California
	http://www.prenhall.com/allbooks/ptr_0132709929.html

It seems pretty decent.

A plug-in that may be useful as model is a Tcl/Tk plug-in,

	http://www.sunlabs.com/research/tcl/plugin/index.html

There are also two plug-in's available for Python
(http://www.python.org). The Oberon Juice system
(http://www.ics.uci.edu/~juice/) is also based on a plug-in.  There
are probably a number of others that can serve as models -- if you
know of any I'd like to hear about them.

There are two choices that need to be made:

	Where do the graphs get presented (and textual input/output)?

		1) In separate windows, more or less as they would be
		by a helper application.

		2) In a subregion of the browser assigned by the EMBED
		tag.

	Where does the code execute?

		A) In a separate process.

		B) In the browser process.

All four combinations are possible (as are various intermediate
positions, but I'll stick to these four). 2B is the standard design for
a plug-in, and is the hardest to implement. 1A is most un-plugin-like,
but easiest to implement, so let's start there.

1A looks very much like using XLISP-STAT or R as a helper application,
but there is an important difference: Plug-in's can allow themselves
to be controlled from Java and JavaScript, so this allows a
Java/SavaScript page to control the statistical system. The simplest
version of this would be very generic -- just start up the application
and control it with some interprocess communication mechanism --
AppleEvents on Mac, DDE or OLE Automation on Windows, X IPC or sockets
or some such on UNIX. This would require developing a protocol and
adding a little code to the application, but is fairly generic. The
same plug-in could be made to handle both XLISP-STAT and R, and lots
of other things. This is so generic, that there probably is a plug-in
available already that does this. The Hamlet system
(http://www.cs.utah.edu:80/~hamlet/hamlet/hamlet/hamlet.html) has some
of these ideas based just on an intermediate helper application -- a
starting point might be to make a plug-in that allows Java control of
Hamlet.

A slightly fancier version of 1A would be to allow the plug-in to
provide a listener window embedded in the browser that can send
commands to the statistical application and display output. Commands
could also be disabled and the window used only for output. The code
for this could be part of the plug-in (which means it would have to be
done separately for each platform) or it could be done portably in
Java. Again this is generic enough that a solution may already exist,
and if not, at least the solution can be made to work for XLISP-STAT,
R, and lots of other systems.

2A and 2B, where at least the graphics appear in the browser window,
require more thought. There two issues: design and implementation.
The design issue involves matching up the user interface model of the
statistical application with the model of the browser. For Tcl/Tk this
is fairly easy: Tk has essentially a one-window view of the
world. Usually that window is a top-level window managed by a window
manager, but having it embedded in another window is not a big step.
R currently has a two-window view: a text window and a graphics
window.  Given a rectangular region in a browser, one could allow the
region to be split into a text pane and a graphics pane by the user or
the program. XLISP-STAT is harder. It currently wants to open a new
window for everything it does. Translating that directly into a
subregion of a browser means implementing a little window manager, in
order not to be too messy. Restricting the plug-in to just one window
eliminates plot linking. It might be possible to allow multiple
plug-in instances (multiple EMBED tags in a page) to correspond to the
same XLISP-STAT process in order to support linking -- that is not in
the spirit of the Netscape plug-in model and may or may not be hard to
do -- I'm not sure. If XLISP-STAT allowed multiple graphs along with
dialogs to be placed in a single top-level window, then a single
window restriction would work -- but maybe that isn't all that
different from having a tiled mini window manager. This aspect needs
to be thougt through very carefully before jumping into the
implementation phase.

For 2A the implementation should be much easier for R -- "all" one has
to do is implement a device driver. Again it could be done natively in
the plug-in for each platform, or the plug-in could simply be a
conduit to a Java device. I am fairly sure John Chambers and Mark
Hansen have already written a Java device driver of some sort for S.
In XLISP-STAT it involves essentially the equivalent of a port to a new
window system. Again it might make sense to do the core in Java so it
is portable, but performance may be a problem. Some
performance-critical parts could be identified and be implemented as
native methods by the plug-in.

2B is the standard model for a plug-in. Following this approach allows
the plug-in to use more standard installation methods and eliminates
the need to use inter-process communication. It does potentially
involve much more work than any other approach. At a minimum it
involves making the core of the base system into a library, which is
not too hard. To be effective, it probably also requires tuning the
system to use less memory than the stand-alone systems do -- that is
more work. It would also require a careful examination of how
resources are released. For a stand-alone application this is not an
issue since the system releases all resources when the program exits
(at least it is supposed to). But a plug-in might get loaded and
unloaded many times within a session -- if it does not properly
release its resources when it is unloaded then this will eventually
bring down the browser.

One issue that affects all approaches has to do with the relationship
between different plug-in instances active at the same time. The
simplest implementation would have all plugin instances run in the
same process, which currently means they would share all global
variables.  This is not ideal since two plug-ins on a page could be
written by two different people and hence interfere with each other.
For example, each might define a function of the same name that does
different things. If XLISP-STAT or R is in a different process, then
at least on UNIX and Win32 it is possible (though wasteful) to avoid
this problem by running a separate process for each plug-in instance.
If the statistical system is run inside the browser process, then
separation is not easy. Tcl/Tk supports the idea of separate
interpreters with their own global worlds running in the same process,
so this can be handled fairly easily. XLISP-STAT currently uses masses
of global variables internally -- I think R does a bit of this
too. These would have to be moved into a single structure which can
then be replicated (at least the modifiable parts) for each plug-in
instance. With luck this could perhaps be accomplished "just" by
writing the right set of preprocessor macros, but it would take some
serious effort. On the other hand, it may also be useful at times to
allow different instances -- two plots on the same page -- to run in
the same global space in order to support linking.

Another issue is security. Automatically loading and running code from
who-knows-where is clearly dangerous -- Java has spent a lot of time
worrying about this. The plug-in should provide at least two levels of
protection. It should allow users to select the sites from which
plug-in's (either particular ones or any one) will be accepted.  It
should also allow the resources a plug-in can access to be controlled.
So for example a plug-n from the local machine might have unlimited
access, but one from outside would not be allowed to use local files
in any way. A lot has been written on this for Java
(http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Programming_Languages/Java/Security/);
the Tcl plug-in developers have also thought about this quite a bit
(http://www.sunlabs.com/research/tcl/plugin/safetcl.html). Another
idea worth considering is signing plug-in code so that code with a
trusted creator can be loaded even if it is at an unknown site. The
MMM browser (http://pauillac.inria.fr/~rouaix/mmm/) does something
like this; it is probably under discussion elsewhere too.

In addition to Netscape plug-ins there are also ActiveX and OpenDoc
components. The 2B architecture would be best for supporting all
three, though a Netscape component can already be incorporated in
ActiveX and OpenDoc (though I don't know if a Java interface is
available at this time -- it probably will be before too long).

One approach to making a system more easily embeddable is to design it
around a small virtual machine and a basic run time system. The
current VM is a bit too large and too heavily entwined with the Lisp
interpreter. A good virtual machine might be able to run both Lisp and
R or S code (maybe also matlab or Gauss code) with the right
compiler. With a good design it might be possible to have several
different VM/run-time implementations, including perhaps one that uses
the Java VM. This could be useful if the JIT compiler technology
really takes off.  There is already one example of using the Java VM
for a Lisp dialect, the Kawa Scheme system (Kawa
http://www.copsol.com/kawa/index.html).

Those are some of the issues. 1A could be done fairly quickly. 2B
would, to make it a good fit, require some internal redesigning. Some
of that redesigning is a good idea anyway, like allowing multiple
graphs in a window and reorganizing the internal globals, but when it
will be done is not clear.

Luke:

I'm very glad to see that you are thinking about plug-ins. Clearly, there
is a lot to be gained from doing something along these lines. The primative
helper approach that I'm using for teaching stat with the web and
XLISP-STAT/ViSta could be greatly improved by having plug-in capability
available, whether or not graphical windows worked inside the browser.
Recent activity in the news group makes it look like there are several
others of us that would also be interested.

I have two points in response to your ramblings:

1) Wouldn't it be desireable to adopt a two-step strategy?
  a) First, implement the "quick and dirty" 1A approach
  b) Second, implement the "slow but elegant" 2B approach?

Your ramblings make it sound like 1A could be implemented without much
effort  in a relatively short time, with a very high probability of useful
results. So... I think you should "go for 1A". Then, with that experience,
and with additional time to think out the issues underlying what to do
about graphical windows, you could decide whether it would be worth the
effort to attack the 2B approach.

2) I am, as you can imagine, very interested in the issue of multiple
graphs in a single window, since this would be particularly suited to
portions of ViSta. If I had such a capability, I would want to be able to
have multiple windows that had multiple graph capability [I don't want
much, do I ;-) ].

The main ViSta GUI consists of 5 graphical windows: WorkMap, GuideMap,
Datasheet, and two namelist windows for variable names and observation
labels. I  wouldn't want to combine these into a single, multiple pane
window.

However, in addition to the ViSta GUI, there are numerous spreadplots that
present visualizations of data and analyses. Each spreadplot consists of
multiple graphs that are presented in multiple windows. It would definitely
be better if they were presented as panes in a single window. There are
about a dozen different spreadplots, so I would want about a dozen
different multiple graph windows.

Thus, what I would like is to be able to have many different windows, some
multi-pane and some not! I wouldn't want to be forced to have all graphs in
the same window.

-=-=-=-=-=-=

It seems to me that there are two separate issues here: One has to do with
how to have multi-pane windows in XLISP-STAT (ignoring questions of the
web). The other has to do with how multiple windows are interface to the
web (whether or not the window is a multi-pane XLS graphic).

Just looking at XLISP-STAT as a stand-alone application, it would be
desirable to rearrange the way things work so that the XLISP-STAT
programmer could create  an instance of a, say,
multi-pane-graph-window-proto object. This object would then be identified
as the window where the instance of a graph-proto appears, being able to
identify what portion of the multi-pane-graph-window-proto is the viewport
for the instance of the graph-proto.

If this were done within XLISP-STAT it would be independent of any thought
about the web. Then there would have to be a second step to work out how
the plug-in would handle many different graphics windows some of which
might contain multiple graphics. However, the plug-in wouldn't have to know
if a graphics window contains one or several graphics.

-=-=-=-=-

My vote would be for your suggestion to implement:

>A slightly fancier version of 1A would be to allow the plug-in to

Graphics windows would be

If you independently gave XLISP-STAT the multi-pane graphics capabilities,
this would work with the above.

Then, after doing the above, decide whether to do the 2B approach.

Excellent ramblings ! Some quick reactions:

(a) Netscape is rapidly losing market share, and it may be in trouble
because it is in direct competition with Microsoft. Although IE and
Cyberdog support Netcape plugins, this may present a problem in the
longer run.

(b) It seems that Java is not in direct competition with anything
produced by Microsoft. Also, IBM and certainly Apple are firmly
committed to Java. It seems to me that JIT compilers are a fairly
safe bet as well.

(c) Plugins need to be installed, and Netscape must be configured
to recognize the corresponding MIME. Many people (students) are not 
able to install anything, unless it comes with an installer.

Because of (a) and (b) and (c) I would rather bet on Java than on plug-ins.

Because of (c) I would rather bet on the server-side than on the
client-side for many instructional applications.

One possibility, not mentioned by Luke, is to use CGI in the
way php and metahtml do it, i.e. you write Xlisp code in HTML
comments directly on the page, and it gets replaced by the
Xlisp-Stat output. This approach (not unlike the UCLA WWW interface
to Xlisp-Stat) does not do graphics, although the gnuplot type
of graphics that now writes tektronix could easily be adapted
to write gif.

Another possibility, also server-side, is to make an Apache
module (as done for php, and even for perl). The system is then
compiled into the HTTP server, and CGI is no longer needed.

Of course this does not exclude the client side, but for most of 
our work at the moment (writing a textbook with demos and calculators) 
leans to the server side.

One problem with this approach, and to some extent with server-side in 
general is that all these processes can bog down your server really 
quickly.  C[++] CGI programs aren't too bad, but if you are spawning an 
XLISP-Stat and a gnuplot as well as a shell or whatever is needed to glue 
it together, you can paralyse quite powerful machines pretty fast. R is 
even slower to load.

It may be possible to reduce the overhead by having the statistics package
running all the time and just spawning little C++ processes to feed
commains to it -- I believe this is done for perl and databases by some
web servers. Even so, the processing requirements will be greater than 
for serving HTML or JAVA programs.

Server-side graphics (especially dynamic ones) will also be very slow for 
people communicating by modem (the same people who may have difficulty 
installing a plug-in, since experts will presumably be available to do it 
for networked university machines).  I remember trying to use a 
server-side demonstration of Penrose tiling from the wrong side of the 
Pacific. The Pacific link is rather faster than your average modem, but 
it was still painfully slow. 

While server-side has lots of advantages I think it would be really 
useful to have a technology that doesn't require so much from the Web 
publisher.  A major project such as the UCLA textbook can justify this 
sort of processing power but it might easily be out of the range of a 
department producing web-based course materials.

May well be, but the API might survive, or not. But components of one
sort or another are clearly here to stay. It would be a good idea to
keep the structure of ActiveX controls and OpenDoc parts in mind while
doing anything for Netscape.

Speed may be a problem, also it would be nice not to have to translate
lots of existing C code (though some form of C2J is either out already
or around the corner). For stand-alone's you can use native methods to
do hook in C code. For applets it is officialy not possible to use
native methods. But in fact the Plug-in/LiveWire combination lets you
use a hidden plug-in as a library of native methods (essentially at
least). At the moment this is the only method for doing this I am
aware of. There may be others, and no doubt there eventually will be
-- moving from Netscape to BrandX should not be too hard if things are
implementad with this posibility in mind.

The inner classes to be included in Java 1.1 should make mapping
high-level languages to Java easier than it is in 1.02.

I haven't looked at the scriptability of Netscape recently, but I
suspect it is actually possible to build an installer that does the
right thing. For what it is worth, the intro PolySci class here at Mn
is making videatapes of lectures available on the web in a form that
requires the VIVO plug-in. I can ask at the end of the quarter how
that went.

Designing any graphics interface/device driver to support server-side
applications as well is certainly a good idea.

In this connection, it is useful to remember that OpenDoc will be
completely rewritten in Java.

A lot of the recent discussion about how to serve .lsp files on the
web, security problems, and choice of mime type reinstates the same
things I grappled with over SAS.

Rather than forcing recipients choose between having *all* .sas files
viewed as plain/text or *all* executed locally (opening themselves
up to security problems), one alternative is use a cgi program
that would display the file as text first, then let the user
decide to run it.  


I sketched this and related ideas in
	http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/Online/sasweb/
which may be of use in the present discussion.

I'm trying to replace the Group 0, Group 1, etc designations
on the one-way output with names from a list.  It's seems to me
that I should just be able to use :predictor-names, but I can't
seem to get it to work.

I've searched The text but couldn't find the part that I was sure
contained some information on this.

Thanks as always!!

If you have tried release 3.48 and have run into any problems please
let me know. I have addressed one reported problem and, unless others
are reported, I hope to put the new version up as the main release
early next week.

Thanks

Hi,

New version is nice and seems to be approximatetly 10%
faster than the previous one for numerical calculation.

But the bug of 'free-color' command is still observed on
the mac version.  'free-color' command does not work
properly except the case of draggin the graphic window
by the mouse, which I previously reported.

Thanks

Hi all,

I have assembled a version (modifying verion 3.48) of XLispStat
for Mac users that lets you use shared libraries rather than 
code resources (as used to import C functions, for example). 
Shared libraries allow you to avoid the special headers needed
to work with code resources, making the C code generic enough
to work with Unix systems as well.  You can also have multiple
entry points.

There's a web page at

	http://compstat.wharton.upenn.edu:8001/~bob/dynload.html

that gives more details.

Bob

I'll put the links in the archive, and I cant wait to try this.
If it does its work well, then this fully deserves to be the 
standard version, I guess. I hate to bring this up, but does it
work with DLL as well, for those who live on the other side of

This is something which sometimes bothers me. There are now many versions
of Xlisp(Stat) with a lot of overlap, but with unique features that
would be useful to have in all versions.

a. Tom Almy's Xlisp-Plus has rationals and bignums.
b. Luke's Xlisp-Stat has a byte-compiler, graphics, statstics,
   linear algebra, and optimization. And Apple Events etc.
c. Jeff Protero's Slisp is a library, which means you can use
   an Xlisp interpreter in your C programs.
d. Bob Stine's XLSPPC-SL has support for shared libraries.
e. Dave Betz is back with YAXLS (yet another Xlisp 3.0) -- 
   I haven't looked at it yet.

It would be nice to have a choice to compile some of these
features in conditionally. I dont like to have all these
versions.

Actually, 3.48 has these too, they are just slightly hidden because /
and expt produce floats. For now there are two back doors:

	divide produces rationals on integer division
	iexpt produces rationals for integer powers

and setting the variable *standard-division* to true makes /, expt,
and ^ behave this way also. Both these measures are only temporary --
once I move the statistical stuff into a package the standard (and
non-vectorized) behavior will be available from the common-lisp
package.

A couple of examples:

i just want you to know that we are mirroring the umnstat
xlispstat repository here in vienna at the url

http://sunsite.univie.ac.at/pub/statistics/ucla/xlispstat/
umnstat.stat.umn.edu/

thanks to a generously donated server from sun microsystems
sunsite vienna at

http://sunsite.univie.ac.at/

is dedicated to 

computer support for mathematics, statistics, and science education

for people in europe getting xlispstat realted stuff
is probably easier to get from our site the from across the atlantic.

we also mirror vista
and a growing collection of math and stats software

I also would like to see this merged into the standard distribution. 
I just happened to be hacking around with Mac Shared Libraries when
I got this note: my interface to our 4pi multichannel analyzer 
( which I will make freely available ) will be using shared libraries -
I need several entry points to the driver interface. I'ld rather not
have to maintain & distribute another version of XlispStat. ( Especially
since Luke has fixed all my other complaints - directory function and
color restrictions - in the latest alpha. ) 

I'm trying to figure out if there is a better linkage mechanism 
than the one currently used. 
 I believe that if some of the xlisp support functions were spun off
into a sharable library, then other shared library code could reference
those routines and they could all use the same calling conventions. 
 This might be a solution to merging features from various versions 
back again. 
 However, using XlispStat calling conventions in library code is 
mutually contradictory with my other goal, which is to be able to
use the same library code with XlispStat, Python, Java, [ name your
one entry here... ] 
 I don't believe there is a solution to the above short of converting
everything to use SOM ( and I'm not sure how difficult that would be! )
but I'm going to think about it a bit more. 
 In the short term, I'm considering putting XlispStat, Python and Java
native method wrappers around the same core code in the same library,
and use a naming convention for the programs to decide which external
to call.

The other advantage of shared libraries is that they can have their
own globals, and automatic initialization and termination routines. 

This is the main reason I chose to use them for this project. 
To talk to hardware drivers, I need to find which slot the 
board is in, open the driver and keep a reference number and
another bit of info around for the other calls. I don't want 
the Lisp code to be responsible for keeping this info and 
passing it on to each call, so the init routine does the default
setup and stores the refNo in it's static global. The other 
routines verify that there is a valid refNo before doing anything. 

However, it might be worth a namechange to keep "open-resource-file"
for something that really open's a resource file. There may be other
future needs to be able to load resources.

Jason Bond's Power Calculator is back at

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/cgi-bin/textbook/powercalc/

with a new and happy interface. It computes power for given
sample size and sample size for given power for normal,
binomial, poisson, exponential, and correlation models;
both for one-sample and two-sample situations.

You click a button, and fill in and submit a form, which
returns the answer. In the background a CGI program in
perl forks an Xlisp-Stat process on our server -- so you
even get your CPU cycles for free.

So I can pull each line to get each line equation.  

[2]For further is there any lisp program, when I change the line equation

the diagram.

Hi group:

I am beginning to prepare XLS/ViSta applets (as my previous mails have
indicated) and have run into a problem.

Lets say I'm using Netscape and I click on a button that is supposed to get
me a file called foo.xli from a server that is configured to serve it up as
an application/x-xlispstat mime type file.

Lets say that Netscape is configured properly to know what to do with this
mime type.

Then, the first time I click that button the file comes across as foo.xli
and everything works right (i.e., XLS starts and loads that file and does
whatever with it).

HOWEVER, with Netscape, the second time I click that button the file comes
across as foo.xli-1234 or somesuch, and XLS complains that:
Error: File needs .lsp or .fsl extension - "foo.xli-1234"

I've looked into this a bit more and I discover the following (all on a Mac):
1) If I use the load function, or if I double-click or drag-and-drop
foo.xli that's OK --- it doesn't have to be .lsp or .fsl.
2) If I do any of above with a file named foo.xli1234, thats OK too!
3) If I do any of above with a file named foo.dingbat, thats OK too!
4) However, foo (with no extension) doesn't work, giving me the .lsp or
.fsl error message.

So, clearly the rules aren't what the error message says.

What are they?

More importantly: How can I get it to be OK with foo.xli-1234 or how can I
strip off -1234, or how can I get Netscape to not do this (IE asks if I
want to replace the prexisting foo.xli with the second one).

We got around this problem by writing an AppleScript to remove the downloaded
version from the desktop after it is loaded.

I have not advertised that we are developing an introductory stat course based on
Lisp-Stat and Java. It is under rapid development since two sections of our Stat
101 (algebra-based) are using the material now. You can see what we are doing if
you point to:
		http://srs.cs.wvu.edu
or:
		http://www.stat.wvu.edu

Running Lisp-Stat requires you to download our Lisp-Stat code. We have not changed
.lsp to .lxi and probably will not do so until Spring break (the first week in
March). Currently, analyses are done in Alpha-Stat and simulations/distributions
are done in IntroStat. At this time only the Mac is supported, but this will be
expanded within the next several months. The above-mentioned AppleScript is part
of the code you will download. Actually The script is the helper app, and it
responds to whatever you want., i.e, .lsp or .xli. However, to demo our stuff you
will need to use .lsp as an extension (until we cahnge the machines across campus
during Spring break). The Script needs to be in the same folder as the XLISP-STAT
application and certain scripting extensions (included) need to be in your System
folder. Read through the examples to see how to use the software, but a simplified
version is on the way.

During Spring break we will also replace Alpha-Stat by Omega-Stat a much larger
development effort including extensive multivariate analyses. It also include
projection tours, dynamic coplots, etc. However, these capabilities will not be
included in the initial release for introductory statistics and in fact the
underlying structure (a M/V/C paradigm) will be hidden from the students. The
multivariate materials will be released during the summer as I development my
multivariate course for the Fall. The Modeling components will be released in the
Spring when I teach my generalized linear model course.

I will provide more details over time.

If you try our IntroStat Web pages (the Interactive Workbook is the focal
point), please do not submit your answers to our server. Our graders will go
crazy. We are writing a server-side Java database which will chech to see
whether or not the sender is registered in our courses. If not, you will
receive a Web page immediately with your answers and you will receive your
answers via e-mail, but you will not have your answers stored on the server
nor will you receive grader comments and the correct answers. However, it will
take several months to complete this software.

We are writing a client-side applet which works with the database to allow
persistence of student answers. As of now the student can submit answers more
than once prior to the due date, but we only grade the last submission.
However, the student must start over again each time since we cannot maintain
the answers in a Netscape form.

The probelm Forrest mentioned is fixed in 3.48 -- 3.49 the rank
problem reported to the list fixed and a few other fvery minor

 Hi all,
 
 I would like to promote the use of xlisp-stat for 
 statistics instruction in the State of Idaho here. 
 
 Recently the Idaho Board of Education is inviting 
 proposals to promote creation and use of alternative
 methods of instruction:
 To increase the rate and quality of student learning;
 To increase faculty productivity;
 To increase access to educational programs; and
 To control costs.
 
 What I have in mind is to develop an internet-based 
 instruction approach. I've been using Splus and SAS 
 since 1986 and I am not sure how they could be used 
 to do so. I heard people have been using XLISP (and
 Java) to develop worksheets and applets on the WWW.
 
 I would like to hear the pros and cons of using XLISP
 in statistics instructions. How feasible is putting
 XLISP on the web? What are the costs? What hardwares
 are needed to support 1000+ students enrolled in
 statistics courses per year.
 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated and thank you
 in advance.

I finally had some time to look at PHP, and I wrote a simple
interface to the Xlisp-Stat GLM Module. Result is

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/calculators/glm/

Computations are in Xlisp-Stat, but CGI is not used, because PHP
is build into our ahttpd daemon. Also, integration of PHP and
HTML is much tighter. Finally, our PHP has gdbm, msql, postgres,
and gd support. All pages ending in php are automatically parsed
for php commands -- given this, it seems quite unnecessary to use SSI,
CGI, and JavaScript. PHP also has file upload, and I guess animations
can be done by client pull/server push. So maybe I dont need Java
either.

Hello! 
1st contact from CATALONIA (spain)- Jaume March

I want to post a message asking the followin question:

I have a pentium 133 MHz, 32Mb RAM, 200Mb free disck-space and running a 
Xlisp-stat GEE procedure with matrix 12000 row data x 7 variables (5 
within, 1 between and 1 binary responses).

And tne trouble is that program shows the message:
      ":error insufficient node space"

The reason for that error, is the machine features?
I think there is a very "basic" question, but in the technical reports or 
web pages on xlisp I can't find any solution myself.
Thanks!!!!!!!!

Am I correct in the belief that there is no way to combine 
dialog-proto's and graph-window-proto's due to their both
being implemented as hardware-objects ? 

All of the example code I've seen of graphs with controls
build their control widgets "by hand". 

Is there any way to embed dialog items in a graph-window ?

[ The next best solution I can think of is to use pop-up menus
  triggered from clicking on text in my graph window, and having
  a menu-item at the end which can call up a model dialog to 
  add new items to the menu. ]

There does not seem to be an equivalent of Common Lisp's 
(GET-DECODED-TIME) in XlispStat/Xlisp-Plus -- only 
(GET-INTERNAL-REAL-TIME). 

Does anyone have a function to convert that int value to
ascii date/time ( or a list of values as GET-DECODED-TIME
returns) on the Mac ? 

I've got my data-acquisition hooks working and I would like

Hi Folks,

I'm interested in accessing all previous commands, rather than just *, **, and
***. What's the easiest way of doing this? It looks like I have to change a
read-eval-print loop somewhere, but where?

	Thanks,
		Andy

If you want an unbounded stack of previous commands, it might be
better to turn on the transcripting ( via 'dirbble' command or menu )
and write a function to search the transcript file for the command 
you want. ( Or, you could just run xlisp  from emacs or alpha, and
use it's recall mechanism. ) 

You would only need to change the read-eval-print loop if you wanted
to add a shortcut for the recall function, like using emacs control
chars or arrow keys. ( If you need that, you might consider trying 
to hook the gnu readline libraries into lisp-stat -- that would 
probably work on Unix, but I have no idea if it would port to Mac of
MSWin. )

Is anyone out there using my xlisp-stat graphic-overlay classes ? 

I'm considering making some major modifications -- not so much
to the functionality, but to the class hierarchy and names. 
All of the current overlay objects use real-space coordinates.
I have need of some other objects -- either using canvas coordinates,
or some combination of constraints(*) to position objects, so I was 
going to factor out some of the common methods and restructure
the classes somewhat. ( & how radically may depend on whether 
anyone else is going to scream! ;-) 



I now need to add some more complex annotation capability, and it
makes sense to do most of this in canvas coordinates, rather than
real. ( Specifically, what I need to add are text labels in rectangle
boxes which are modifiable -- clicking in the box will bring down
a popup menu of alternative tags, double clicking will bring up a 
dialog box --  unless I find a way to add dialog controls to a graph
window, which would be a better way. ) 




[ (*) Text labels currently use a bastardized combination of real &
coordinate space: x,y position is in real graph coordinates, but 
positive or negative infinity is taken to mean top|right or bottom|
left edge of the graph, so I can, for example, position a label 
over a peak, but at the top or bottom of the graph where it is not
likely to be obscured by data points. ]

For several source files ( in xlisp-stat 3.47 ) which all compiled
without problem in CW10, I get with CW11 C, the error:

Internal compiler error: File 'Operands.c'  Line: 828 

and a line number from my sources. The same error occurs with

Anyone have a clue ?

Could anyone who is familiar with S-plus (Win) and xlisp-stat (Win) give
me some idea of what they might use each for? ie what are the strengths
and weaknesses for different types of tasks.

My impression is that xlisp-stat is superior graphically and may be
ultimately more flexible, but that S-plus has got oodles of built-in
functions to reduce some of the analytic programing effort. Please tell me
if this couldn't be more wrong...

With just one fast-disappearing lifetime, I appreciate any insights...

Many thanks,

A new alpha-level release of xlispstat, 3.49, is now available from
ftp://ftp.stat.umn.edu/pub/xlispstat/Alpha. There were enough little
bugs and I did enough tinkering to warrant another alpha release. If
this one proves to be stable enough, it will become the primary
release.

Mostly this release just fixes bugs. There is, however, one
substantive change, in reponse to prompting from Steve Majewski and
Sandy Weisberg:

The protocol used by the standard :redraw-content methods has been
augmented to support maintaining a background for plot
contents. Instead of erasing the content area before drawing the
content, these methods now send the :clear-content message.  The
default method for this method clears the content area. By overriding
this method, you can draw any background you want to maintain.

Unless you want to handle clearing the background yourself, you should
begin your method with a call to call-next-method.

A simple example: The code

	(setf p (plot-points (normal-rand '(10 10))))

	(defmeth p :clear-content ()
	  (call-next-method)
	  (send self :frame-rect 50 50 100 100))

sets up a plot that contains a rectangle in its background.

This new protocol is still experimental and may change if a better
design is found.

Well, I'm not very familiar with them on Windows, but I've used both.

I think your impression is basically correct. 


S-plus is a higher-level, user-oriented language, with a lot of statistical

procedures built in -- it's an interactive statictics application. 

LispStat is more flexible, but  not as complete or polished. It's a
language
for writing interactive statictical applications or for experimenting with
new types of interactive statictical graphics. 
 


If you want to do something "standard", it's going to be easier in S-plus.

If you want to try to do something new or not supported in S-plus, it's
probably
going to be easier in LispStat. 



S-plus has several good books about using it for doing statistics. 
But the documentation on how to really customize it is a bit thin. 

 LispStat documentation is thinner in general, but it's more programmer 
oriented. Plus, it's Lisp - for which there is plenty of books, tutorials,
& 
documentation.  


The above is a wild and subjective generalization, but I don't think it's
too far
off the mark.  I did quite a bit of evaluation of them both before
launching on
a project -- I can't swear that what I wanted to do was impossible to do in
S-plus,
but if it was possible, there were no examples or documentation to guide me

in that sort of low level programming. 

Some examples of my XlispStat graphics are on: 


	http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Docs/xesapp.html


	http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Docs/jitterplot-examples.html


( I've now got interface code to our spectrometer, so I can graph and
analyze 
  data real-time.)

There is a bug in the C compiler when implicitly converting a float to a
double as happens in an assignment or other operations.  This causes this
internal compiler error.  If you use the native doubles instead of floats
this should solve your problem.  A fix is at hand and should be out any
time now.

I just got a patch emailed from Metrowerks for the CW11 compiler bugs
I reported. This is not yet posted on their web site, so if anyone else
wants to try it out, let me know and I'll mail you a copy. 

I'll probably be giving it a test Real Soon, so if you're in now hurry,
you can wait for my report. I'm only sending this note now because 
I see Luke has just released a new alpha 3.49, and someone else may
need it right away.

I've been an SPlus user for several years, but have only started working
with xlisp-stat recently. What attracted me to xlisp-stat was:

(1) the ease with which you can use it to develop and prototype dynamic
graphics. 
(2) Its open and extensible architecture;
(3) The price is right;
(4) I once took a course in LISP (you don't need to know LISP to use
xlisp-stat.  I'm just fond of OOP languages!)

Splus has a _huge_ number of objects, and the pile seems to grow daily.
xlisp-stat is not exactly lacking in the area of built-in fuctions: check
out Luke Tierney's 1990 book (Wiley), and you'll see what I mean! I'd say
the learning curve for Splus is steeper than for xlisp-stat, but some would
disagree.

I'm not sure what you mean by "more flexible." Since Splus has so many
functions, it may reduce programming effort if the functions are what you
need.

A 32-bit MS Windows version of SPlus is still being beta-tested.  It should
be available later this year (June, maybe?).  A 32 bit version of
xlisp-stat has been available for a bit.

Hope the above is some help,

Here are a couple of the major differences:

1) Graphics Engine.

One of the biggest drawbacks of S is that it still has a plotter based
graphics package.  I find S easier to use for fancy static graphics
with lots of overlays.  Xlisp-stat's big advantage comes from its
ability to support dynamic graphics.

2) Memory model

S stores data objects on disc while XLS stores them in memory.  One
consequence is that S storage is persistent.  XLS should also be
faster with some operations as a consequence, but S will handle larger
data sets (although with the price of memory, thats not as much of a
problem as it used to be).

3) Programming Ease

I'd say this one is a toss-up.  S has a more C-like syntax for those
who have a mental block about parentheses. S also has a truely bizarre
object model (class identity and method dispatch are completely
divorced from object encapsulation.)  Also, I find the S lazy
evaluation harder to understand than the Lisp eager evaluation rules.

Unfortunately, xlisp lacks many of the debugging tools which makes
Lisp so easy to use.

(Which reminds me, did I ever post my debugging code to the list?)

4) Functionality

S-Plus definetly has more, and more thorough testing.  Both
collections of functions reflect the research interestsof their
respective authors:  S tends to favor robust procedures and XLS
Bayesian.  On the other hand, if you really need a specific function,
try SAS.

5) Support

Luke does a great job for a one man show, but part of the price of
S-Plus is the ability to call somebody on the phone to hold your hand
while you go through the mysteries of configuring S-Plus to work on
your PC with your printer.  Also, there are training couses
available. 

6) Price

XLS costs fewer dollars, but morein sweat equity.  Thus, it tends to
be favored by researchers and teachers who are willing to put in the
effort to get it to do what they want.

Generally, I think the comparisons of S-plus and XLS have been
fair. Also, there is one in Statistical Science some time ago.
Although we have both, the five major and overriding reasons
why I would not even consider using S-plus are perhaps worth repeating.

(a) XLS comes with complete source code -- in ANSI C. Generally it 
    is a breeze to port it to a new flavor of UNIX. It is quite
    easy to extend it at compile time, and by now it is also
    easy to extend it at runtime with object code. One can always
    go back to the source in case of doubt. One can look at the
    source and marvel.

(b) XLS runs on the Mac, in fact that is where both XLS and I
    prefer to be most of the time. The other two are just necessary
    evils.

(c) I can give it away to my students and my family, in unlimited
    quantities, and for their own home computers, no matter what
    hardware and OS they have. I can provide WWW interfaces to
    the program which run for free from the web servers -- I dont
    think the S-plus people would appreciate a similar service. 

(d) Porting from Common Lisp is now easy. Porting from FORTRAN
    to CL, and then to XL is now easy. Lisp is a general purpose
    language. There are lots of books on Lisp. Lisp is a beautiful
    language. Because of XLS I now read books such as "On Lisp"
    or Norvig or Steele. 

(e) Dynamic graphics for demos, instructional modules, and research
    tools cannot really be done in S. Computing and making static
    plots is perhaps marginally easier in S, but this is not what
    I do.

[1] Install the "970217 Compilers/Linkers" CW11 patch. 
   ( I expect this will show up on their web page soon, if not
     you can ask them for it, or ask me and I'll forward a copy.
     If one does show up on their web, it may be a more final and
     tested version than the one I have. ) 

[2] replace #define in  Transkel1.c:
	#include <GestaltEqu.h>
    with:
	#include <Gestalt.h>


[3] replace #define in xlisp.h
	#include <Picker.h>
    with:
	#include <ColorPicker.h> 


[4] in CWHeader.h, remove:  #define EACCESS	



[5] for PPC, need to change project settings for prefix file
	from "CWHeaderPPC" to "CWHerder.h"


[6] in MacHeader.pch, change OLDROUTINENAMES define from 0 to 1:
	#define OLDROUTINENAMES	1 


( I also always add the prefix "::" to the target so that the 
  executable will be in the same parent directory where the 
  init.lsp and other .lsp files are, rather than in the 
  :macintosh subdirectory. ) 



It compiles and builds PPC version for me with those changes. 
Minimal test that I can load and run my application -- no problems seen.

Hi,

I try to compile xlispstat-3-44 on a DEC Alpha running Linux. At the end
of the compilation process I get the following error message:

make: *** [compiler/backquot.fsl] Error 139

Could anybody explain me that error message, which supposably does not
come from the C-compiler.

I used to have that all the time on a PC with a bad memory card.
(similar to the random errors which might occur while recompiling the
kernel or gcc, or any other intensive use of memory).  

They (the errors) went away when I replaced the memory.  

Maybe the same holds for you? (YMMV).

Even though S and S-plus are commercial products, there is GPL'd free
S like program called "R."  Authors suggest the S "Blue book" for a
manual. Except for complex numbers, it is mostly compatible. INcludes

You can do the same with R.

Here xlisp-stat shines.

Apparently, if you also define OLDROUTINELOCATION on the next line,
you should not require these two changes:

Hi Folks,

First thanks for the solution on my problem about

 ":error insufficient node space"

In Luke words " I don't know how much memory GEE uses. But task manager 
shows there is big process. And I increased my virtual memory.

Now there is another question. After 25 hours running a GEE in the P133MHz 
(now 1'5 GB free memory) the system shows de message:

"Complex Cholesky not available yet 
Happened in #<Subr-CHOL-DECOMP:#77e550>"

I'm following a report about GEE in Xlisp-stat and I'm doing (I think) the 
same procedure.

What's does the message mean? It looks like I need to load another ".lsp" , 
but which?

The loaded lsp are:
         glim.lsp and .fsl
         modelformula.lsp and 
         gee_1_0.lsp or gee_3_0.lsp

        Thanks,
                Jaume

I think I missed your earlier question, so I'm not sure exactly what GEE
model and data you're using that takes so much time and space.  However,
if you're using my GEE code, as it appears, this means that a matrix
you're trying to invert contains complex numbers.  This is due to an
earlier correlation matrix not being positive definite. 

That is, the problem is with the correlation matrix, which is not being 
estimated as positive definite. What working correlation are you using 
and what is your data structure like?

Two solutions: try a different working correlation structure (if you 
can't get reliabily positive-definite estimates of the one you're using 
then the GEE asymptotics probably don't apply very well) or  replace 
the call to (inverse) in the :estimate and :rinv methods of the 
correlation structure by calls to the following function which provides 
an inverse to the "nearest" positive definite matrix instead of to the 
matrix you supplied.

(defun positive-inverse (mat) 
   (let ((Linv (inverse (first (chol-decomp mat)))))
     (matmult (transpose Linv) Linv)
))

Hi and Thanks for messages!

Sorry, the problem "is" with the correlation matrix. 

> Thomas Lumley:
> which is not being estimated as positive definite. 

When I selected only the :error poisson, :link is the default and 
:correlation exchangeable-corr, it works. Perhaps the trouble is a bad 
combination logit-link or log-link with binomial-error???

> Thomas Lumley:
>What working correlation are you using and what is your data structure

About working correlation, I'm, for the moment, only learning or testing.
And that's the explanation for the Cholesky's message!

The data structure is: 9600 binary responses, 4 binary predictor variables 
and 2 categorical predictor variable.

And finally, yes I'm using your GEE code, and I have another two problems. 
The first is that as-formula only runs with a approximately 500 
observations, with the entire sample (9600) a "stack overflow" message 
appears. Is there a limitation?

And the second is when there is a variable like subject with multiple 
observations (rows) and a second grouping variable that means "nesting" and 
there's no way of doing something?

Some of the discrepancy about which MacHeaders mods are required to 
compile have to do with whether or not the Project Stationary patch has
been
applied. I hadn't looked closely at the release notes because I thought
it just affected new projects created from the Project Stationary, however
the patch makes some changes in the defaults for precompiled MacHeaders. 

If you haven't applied that patch, you may not require some of the changes.

Well -- the good news is that this change doesn't affect any of my
modifications.
I can still run my code unchanged. 

However, when I tried to modify my code to use the new feature, I found it
didn't quite work as I expected.


I had the following two redefinitions:

:REDRAW-BACKGROUND was modified to draw a x/y grid on the background
behind the graph.

 ( defmeth scatterplot-proto :redraw-background ()
    (call-next-method)
    ( let (( color ( send self :grid-color )))
        ( if color  (send self :draw-grid :color color)))
    ( let (( color ( send self :axis-color )))
       ( if color  (send self :draw-zero-axis :color color))))

and :REDRAW-CONTENT was redefined to redraw the content without
erasing the content-region. 

( defmeth scatterplot-proto :redraw-content ()
	( let (( vars ( send self :current-variables )))
		(send self :draw-data-lines (car vars) (cadr vars) 0 (send self
:num-lines))
		(send self :draw-data-points (car vars) (cadr vars) 0 (send self
:num-points))))


I  first tried replacing by :redraw-background with a similar, but renamed
:clear-content, and eliminating the redefinition of :REDRAW-CONTENT,
but it didn't have the same effect, so I did a bit of testing to discover
where
that call fits into the protocol:


:REDRAW-BACKGROUND
:REDRAW-OVERLAYS
:REDRAW-CONTENT
	( which calls :CLEAR-CONTENT )


In the case of my code, which uses overlays drawn in the content rect, this

clears and overwrites the overlays. 


The solution seems to be to keep the background/ grid drawing in 
:REDRAW-BACKGROUND, to cut the redefinition of :REDRAW-CONTENT,
and to add a null :CLEAR-CONTENT method that *doesn't* (call-next-method).


( defmeth scatterplot-proto :clear-content () )

[ Note: I got rid of my initial separate/parallel implementation of
data-overlays
  once I realized that LispStat graphic overlays are really graphically,
underlays
 ( under the graph content ) but on top of the graph content in their
event/click
  dispatching -- which turned out to be exactly what I wanted. It just
wasn't 
 initially clear that that was the case. ] 


Results:

   The new way is slightly simpler and shorter that the old way, but it's
not
   a significant change either way.

   The main problem I had was and is still understanding the whole flow 
   of the redraw protocols, and which methods trigger which other methods. 
   More/better documentation is probably more important that more changes 
    to the protocol. 

   With both the before and after versions of my modified scatterplot
classes 
   loaded, Tourdemo and the other standard examples appear to run correctly
   without change. 

   The sort of changes that would be REALLY NICE are ones that I know to be
  not trivial: better. more general linking mechanism; a way to mix dialog 
  controls and text regions in a graphics window. ( Tk and Java's AWT both 
  have a Canvas item as a widget that can be placed in a window container. 
 Their Windows are just generic containers. So you can create a window with
  a graphics canvas and controls and text fields mixed together. )

I have a problem with writing text in my graph windows.
I believe my window WITH text, is being overwritten by one
without.

How do I assign text to my graph object that will "stick" ?

I assume you are just writing text with :DRAW-TEXT or :DRAW-STRING
Those methods, as well as the low level graphic methods like
:FRAME-RECT, et. al. is that they are immediate, not retained mode. 
They draw when you give the command, but they don't create a permanent
object that is redraw when the graph is redraw or resized. 

You need your low level draw methods to be called by one of the redraw
methods. A graph :REDRAW causes the sequence:
	:REDRAW-BACKGROUND
	:REDRAW-OVERLAYS
	:REDRAW-CONTENT
to be send to itself.

You can either redefine one of those methods to redraw your text, or
you can create a text overlay which will get called by :REDRAW-OVERLAYS.

You can see my graph overlay methods for an example:

especially realgraf.lsp. 
[ See the comments in the source and my previous message to this list about
   :CLEAR-CONTENT for some more tips. ] 


Note: The code at that URL is a bit out of date. I'll have a newer version
posted
real soon.  All of the overlays in that example use real space coordinates.
I'm 
going to add some other canvas based coordinate overlays, including, I
hope,
a composite rectangle-with-text-field-and-drop-down-menu-or-edit-dialog... 
I haven't finished the changes or gotten the documentation up to sync yet.

We've had some discussion about this before, and I've posted some code
examples, but I've gone thru a couple of implementations before I settled
on the current one, so I'll try to summarize the history:

Yes: your intentions were not clear from the book or other documentation,
and it took some experimenting to figure out what the graph/update 
protocol actually is.  

The sequence initiated by a :REDRAW of a graph is:
	:REDRAW-BACKGROUND
	:REDRAW-OVERLAYS
	:REDRAW-CONTENT 
however, :REDRAW-CONTENT clears the content rect before drawing the 
content, so anything draw in the background or overlays in the content-rect
is lost.  ( The only difference in the new version is that now
:REDRAW-CONTENT
calls the graph's :CLEAR-CONTENT method, which can be overridden. ) 

We had some discussion about this on the list where you stated your
intention
about the limitations of overlays and that you had not expected them to be
used
in the content region of the graph. 

I started, in my next implementation, to construct a parallel to
GRAPH-OVERLAY-PROTO's called CONTENT-OVERLAY-PROTO, which would be redrawn
after the 
content had been cleared and redrawn.  I posted a version of this code, but
I was not
happy with it's performance.  Although the standard overlays are actually
UNDER-
lays as graphical elements -- they are draw before the content, they ARE
overlays 
with respect to their order in event processing. Overlays get a chance to
:DO-CLICK
before the graph itself catches the event. Except for the erase of the
content area,
the standard overlays actually behaved exactly as I wanted. I really wanted
graphic
underlays -- the graph content should always be visible -- but I wanted
event 
priority. 

So in the next and current implementation, I threw out all of the
duplication of
code to construct CONTENT-OVERLAYs that did basically the same thing as the
builtin overlays, and instead rewrote scatterplot 's :REDRAW-CONTENT to 
just redraw the data points and lines, without clearing the content area. 
( What has changed in the latest version is that instead of overriding
:REDRAW-
CONTENT,  I can override :CLEAR-CONTENT to do nothing. ) 

This produced the desired behaviour, with better performance,  with less
modification to the standard behaviour of SCATTERPLOT-PROTO and
the code was much easier to read and understand. 

 I'm still not even sure that the :CLEAR-CONTENT call is required in most
 plots. Even with my mods to make it a noop, all of the animated demo 
graphs I've tried seem to work the same. However, this is with minimal
testing
on a Mac only. I don't know if the call to :CLEAR-CONTENT is required 
on other platforms to get the same behaviour. ( I've tested my code on the
Windows version -- which caused me to rename some of the files with 8+3 
filenames. That was the only problem I noticed. ) 


[ You may recall, the other problem I had complained about was that the 
  plot linking mechanism had built into it assumptions about the
implementation
  of the linked objects: they had to be instances of HARDWARE-OBJECT-PROTO
 with a HARDWARE-ADDRESS slot that pointed to the correct internal 
 implementation object. In this case, I had to retain a complete
reimplementation
 of the linking protocol -- XLINKABLE-PROTO & STATEFUL-PROTO -- so that I 
 could link either  overlay items on a graph to points on a name-list, or
points on
 a summary   plot to plots of the raw-data plot from which that point was
derived.  ] 


One of my goals was to minimize the changes to the built in graph
prototypes, 
however modification, rather than inheritance, was necessary because there
is not another abstraction layer in between SCATTERPLOT-PROTO and the
standard graph functions: plot-points, plot-lines, plot-function.  Perhaps
it 
would be better if those functions created an instance of USERPLOT-PROTO,
where USERPLOT-PROTO is initially inherited from SCATTERPLOT-PROTO
with no changes.  This would user modification of USERPLOT-PROTO without
having to change the default built-in behaviour of SCATTERPLOT-PROTO. 


You can see the screen dump at 
	http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Docs/xesapp.html

for an example of my overlays and linking. ( The linking is displayed 
by the blue overlay peaks being selected on both the main graph and
the name-list graph of elemental peak references. ) 

Source code, class hierarchy diagrams and some other notes are at:

	http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Docs/SourceIndex.html

-- sorry, one generation out of date. I'll be posting a newer version soon.




To more directly answer your question of why not move these methods into
:CLEAR-CONTENT -- that would again get me into reimplementing the existing
overlay mechanism -- 
  I need complex hierarchical objects. 
	( for example, a peak overlay with  elemental lines and text labels
attached. )
  I need a sequential ordering of objects, both grapically and for event
processing. 
  	( for example, the lines and labels for the above will only be displayed
if that
	peak is selected. ) 
  I need to dynamically change the overlay sequence (:BRING-TO-FRONT), add
and
delete overlays, and change their state, color, etc. and link them to other
objects. 
          (dynamic behaviour not obvious in the screen dump. When a peak is
selected
          by clicking under the peak, it is brought to the front, redrawn
with a thicker line, 
          text labels and elemental lines are made visible and the proper
linking messages
          are sent to the name-list-proto with a list of elemental peak
reference names. 
          You can also select a peak from the linked name-list with the
same effect. )   
 Except for the fact that by default, they get erased if they are in the
content rect, the
existing overlay-proto and their protocol/interaction with scatterplots is
exactly what
I need.  ( i.e. IMNSHO  I think it's the assumption that overlays exist
only outside the 
content  region that is the thing that needs to be "fixed" :-) 


For more detail on the current class hierarchy, below is the comments from
the current
source snapshot of  realgraf.lsp.  I  am reorganizing the hierarchy
somewhat from the
version on my web pages, and I'm going to be adding some new classes that
use canvas
coordinates rather than real space, and some composite graph objects that
create text fields
with drop-down menus to change the text, for example. 

The web pages will be updated with the latest version when that is
complete.
If anyone wants the current working snapshot before that, please let me
know.

Regarding graph overlays - I'm not sure I've completely followed all
the discussions, but there are things that I've been doing or have
wanted to do which I've found difficult under the current
implementation.  My hope is that any changes made would help to
support these sorts of actions.

For example, I've wanted boxes around 3d plots instead of axes.  Under
the current implementation, what I did was turn off the axes and add
lines to the plot.  However, I think this is an ugly solution, and can
interfere with plot manipulation (because of the extra elements in the
plot).  It's also a pain because one needs to keep track of the lines
added so that one can turn off the axes again, (if they haven't
already been erased by a :clear-lines message).  I suppose an
alternative would have been to use the overlay facilities, but then
I'd have to go and do the 3d -> screen mappings myself, which is a
pain.

Add to this all the additional things one would want from a box around
one's data, such as perhaps a grid on the bottom & two back sides of
the box, or tick marks, or labels with values, and both of the above
seem like poor solutions.

Another thing that I've found to be awkward is working with colored
plots.  For example, if I want to plot 3 functions in 3 different
colors, I have to, for each function, record the number of lines,
plot the function, get the number of lines, and change the color of
the new lines.  I'd be nice if there was an easier way to do this -
perhaps default colors that wouldn't affect the entire graph, but
would just be used for all new elements added to a graph.

One solution which comes to mind would be if one could construct a set
of graph protos which all draw in the same window.  Another
possibility might be for a graph proto to have a list of children
graph protos, which again all draw in the same window.  I guess one
would have to be careful about which messages go just to the parent,
and which also go to the children.  But, once one can construct
different graph protos which draw on the same window, one can fairly
easily wire things up in an appropriate fashion.

I agree. I haven't looked at the spin-proto implementation yet. 
I suppose a 3d version of my 2-d graphic overlays could be done. 
The 2d reals only have to call :real-to-canvas. I suppose spin-proto
has to call :apply-transformation and perhaps some other methods. 

For the 3d boxes, you could just redefine :draw-axes to do a box. 
( You might want to add an axes-color slot and setter/getter method.)

Doing the 2d real-to-canvas was not too much of a pain -- and the
advantage of OO programming is that once it's done the first time,
you don't have to do it again.  ( That's why I have an abstract real-graf-
proto that all of my real-space 2d objects inherit from. )

This is exactly what my classes do. 
( Take a look at the URL I posted for a screen dump of an example. )

I am plotting an unknown spectrum, with plot-points, and also adding
an overlay that colors the area under the points. After doing a fit, I
draw reference peaks scaled by the fit-results coefficients in different
colors, and add a linked namelist containing the reference names. 
Clicking on either the name or clicking under the curve selects that
reference in both linked windows. I also draw the residuals as another
colored region, and I draw the continuums ( background regions that
are used for measuring the total mass and are needed to scale the 
coeffecients into concentration. ) in another fill color. 

[ These plots are quite "busy" which is why I needed to use filled 
   areas as an alternative to line plots. ] 

All of these overlays are individually selectable and their line widths,
line-color, fill-color, state, etc. can me changed, as well as their order
in the overlay list. 

The jitterplot examples do something different with overlays:
they do jittered ( randomized slightly in the x-dimension ) distribution
plot of grouped data, and they add a standard boxplot in an overlay, 
as well as a cloud-plot -- 2 filled ovals of 1 and 2 standard deviations. 
It also adds a grouping to the data points, so you can easily change 
the color of all the points in group-2, for example.

After messages about trying overlays in 3-d plots, I was trying
out some of the spin-proto functions ( without any of my mods 
loaded ) and I find: 

   spin-function, without adding a optional :color keyword arg
  gives the error:
	Error: unknown color - NIL
	Happened in: #<Subr: #1859e30>
  If you append ":color 'red" or some other color to the arg list
  you don't get an error. 

  I think I got a similar error with :add-function method.

  With :abcplane method, I get the same error, however, if you
  try to add a :color keyword arg to the method call, it complains
  about too many args.

It's looks like  an old bug I uncovered.

It looks like the problem  is that :add-surface has a color keyword 
argument with no default value. ( defaults to Nil )

 in graph2.lsp: 

(defmeth spin-proto :add-surface (x y z &key (draw t) (type 'solid)
					(spline 3) color)


:add-function will pass a color arg on via apply:
   (apply #'send self :add-surface x y z args)))
but :abcplane does calls :add-function with no extra args, so
color defaults to Nil.

The xlispstat-3-49-files.sea distribution seems to be missing some
lisp sources -- loading from the workspace is OK, but if I try to
load init, I get errors from missing common2.lsp and others. 
( These missing files are in the source code distribution though. )

If I try to load graph2.lsp, I get the error:

	Error: not a valid graph address - try reallocating the object
	Happened in: #<Subr: #1860550>


which appears to be from the line:

	(send spin-proto :scale-type 'variable)

Change this to

 	(send spin-proto :scale-type 'variable :draw nil)

The color problem in spin-function is new -- I added :color to
:add-surface but never checked it without color. This is best handled
by a little internal change in the C code, which I have made.

I changed the previous function to return the dialog rather
than to call it's :modal-dialog method. 

This works more precisely as I wanted: the editable-text dialog 
items keep their :text values once set, so that they remain the
defaults the next time I call :mocal-dialog. 

But -- how do I keep the dialog box from appearing initially
when I first create the dialog. I just want to create it and
keep it in reserve for when it's needed. ( which will be on
every file save. )

Hi folks:

I've got a problem I'm wondering about with the functions sv-decomp and eigen.

I'm using XLispStat 3.44 on a Mac.

If I have a square symmetric (indefinite) matrix B and I do
  (setf svd (sv-decomp B))
  (setf singvals (second svd))
Then I get singular values which, as advertised, are in decreasing order.

If, instead, I do
  (setf eig (eigen B))
  (setf evals (first eig))
Then I get eigenvalues that are the same as the singular values, except
that some differ in sign. Since the eigenvalues are also arranged in order,
they are ordered differently than the singular values. If I do
  (setf evals2 (reverse (sort-data (abs evals))))
Then evals2 is the same as singvals, within acceptable tolerance.

(The functions eigenvalues and eigenvectors work the same as eigen.)

Is this a bug? Is this as it should be? If not a bug, why?

I am trying to fit a loglinear model with a linear trend 
 and am having trouble.  The example comes from
Haberman 1978 and is a 2x2 table of attitude rating by year.  The
attitudes are "Too Harshly", "Not Harshly Enough", "About Right",
"Don't Know", "No Answer", for the years 1972-1975.  I've defined
the variables as listed below and fit a log-linear model of 
independence which works fine.  But how do I introduce into the
model attitude*(linear year)?

As always, thanks in advance for the help!

I have also written a model formula package (available from the UCLA
archive or http://www.biostat.washington.edu/~thomas/gee.html) which
allows slightly simpler specification of these sorts of models: eg

(def your-model (as-formula '((factor year) (factor atts) (interaction
(list year atts) :is-factor (list nil t)))))

returns a model formula object (here atts is a string version of attitudes
using eg "th" instead of th). This object contains a design matrix,
variable names, and grouping information that can be used to construct eg
a Wald test for the set of four interaction variables).  There are also
modifications for regression-model so that it accepts model formula
objects as predictors and displays these Wald tests.  The following
function extends this modification to poisson regression 

(defun poissonreg-formula (formula-object y &rest args &key
(predictor-names nil has-names) (print-summary t) (intercept t) (print t))
"Like poissonreg-model but uses a formula instead of the x argument"
(let* (
       (name-list (if has-names predictor-names (send formula-object
:name-list)))
       (result (apply #'poissonreg-model (list (send formula-object
':design-matrix) y  ':predictor-names name-list ':print (null
print-summary) args)))
  )
  (send result :add-slot 'formula formula-object)
  (if print-summary (send result :display-with-formula t))
  result
))

so that

Unfortunately the coding for the dummy variables is not the same as given

(indicators) codes the first observation by zeroes.

If you create or edit a "XLS Preferences" file in the same directory as the

XLISP-STAT application, you can put in lines like:

	ListenerFontSize 12
	ListenerFontName  Monaco
	EditFontName Courier
	EditFontSize 12
	GraphFontName  Helvetica
	GraphFontSize 10
	Color yes 

to change some of the defaults. However, this does *not* change the System
font (Chicago) that is used to draw the window title bars, menus, etc.
For that, you either need to either hack the system resourecs to do it 
globally, or modify XlispStat to do it locally.   
[ "XLS Preferences" is documented in the doc/changes.* file ]

Example 1: non-modal-dialog  -- the :action methods for each item 
  modify the target when clicked. This makes a non-modal dialog window
  that allows setting of the graphs x & y max and turns on full view or 
  partial scrolling. ( I note that my list-item also requires a double
click -- 
  I guessing this is a feature. ) This is one of my earliest attempts. I'ld

  probably  do it differently now:
------

( defmeth scatterplot-proto :make-range-widget ()
  ( let* ((xmax ( cadr (send self :range 0)))
          (ymax ( cadr (send self :range 1)))
          (hmax-label  ( send text-item-proto :new "Horiz. max:" ))
          (hmax-value  ( send text-item-proto :new "" :text-length 4 ))
          (hmax-scroll ( send interval-scroll-item-proto :new  ( list 1
xmax )
                              :text-item hmax-value 
                               :action #'(lambda (x) ( send self :range 0 0
x ))))
          (vmax-label  ( send text-item-proto :new "Vert. max:" ))     
          (vmax-value  ( send text-item-proto :new "" :text-length 6 ))
          (vmax-values (nice-dseq ymax))
          (vmax-scroll ( send sequence-scroll-item-proto :new  vmax-values 

                             :text-item vmax-value  
                             :action #'(lambda (y) (send self :range 1 0 y
))))
          (hs-top  ( send text-item-proto :new "Horiz. Scroll range:" ))
          (hscroll ( send list-item-proto :new 
                         ( list "None" "1/2" "1/3" "1/4" "1/5"  ) 
:selection 0  
                         :action  
                          #'(lambda (n)
                              ( when n
                                     ( let (( n ( send hscroll :selection
))) 
                                       (send self :has-h-scroll
                                             ( if (zerop n) nil 
                                                  (* (car (send self
:size)) (1+ n)))))))))
          (vscroll (send toggle-item-proto :new "use vertical scroll" )))


------
example 2: modal dialog. For a modal dialog, you usually don't need an
:action for
 the dialog items except for the final OK that dismisses the dialog. That
needs
 to gather up all of the :text or :value values from the items. 

When called with something like:
	( setf dlg ( many-strings-dialog 
  		"Experimenter:" "Specimen-ID:" "Structure:" "Treatment" ))
	( send dlg :modal-dialog )

It will return something like:
	(("Experimenter:" "Steve") ("Specimen-ID:" "10111") ("Structure:" "Cyto") 

			("Treatment" "control") ("Comments:" ""))

It is a bug in the mac version -- on Windows and X11 single clicks
call the method also and they should on the mac too. I'll fix that

 A discussion about graphics API's on another list reminded me of 
this issue -- I'ld like to float it by and see if it is a concern 
to anyone else: 

  I have sometimes been forced to use modifications to scatterplot-proto's
behaviour, rather than creating a subtype, because the standard ploting
function have a hardwired prototype. This applies for both major changes
like my overlay graphics, and minor setting of defaults, like size
or background color. 
  If an extra level of indirection/abstraction is inserted into those
default functions, for example, if plot-lines, instead of calling
scatterplot-proto's :new method, tries to create an instance of 
"user-lineplot-proto" - which would by default be bound to
scatterplot-proto -- this would leave room for insertion of user plot
defaults without having to modify the base classes. 
  My "lisp logic" tells me not to expect any difference in performance 
in the default case where "user-lineplot-proto" is just an alias to
scatterplot-proto, but I haven't tested this. [ BTW: *Is* there an
overhead associated with the depth of inheritance in classes ? Is there
any performance reason to prefer flatter class hierarchies ? ]

    If an extra level of indirection/abstraction is inserted into those
  default functions, for example, if plot-lines, instead of calling
  scatterplot-proto's :new method, tries to create an instance of 
  "user-lineplot-proto" - which would by default be bound to
  scatterplot-proto -- this would leave room for insertion of user plot
  defaults without having to modify the base classes. 

This is an example of a "Meta-Object Protocol" or what I was calling
an Open Implementation Protocol in several "generic" functions which
can be specialized.  Therefore if you were using Common Lisp (with
CLOS as opposed to Xlisp) you might write:

(defgeniric fit-model (model-type data-set)
	(:documentation
          "Fits a model and prints a table of summary statistics."))

(defgeneric build-data-matrix (model-type data-set)
	(:documentation 
	  "Builds the data matrix for fitting a particular model.")
	(:returns y x))
(defgeneric solve-data-matrix (model-type y x)
	(:documentation
	  "Finds the parameters of the model."))
(defgeneric print-model-summary (fit-model)
	(:documentation 
	  "Prints the results of the model fit."))

(defmethod fit-model ((model-type Model) (data-set T))
	(multiple-value-bind (y x)
	   (build-data-matrix model-type data-set))
	(let ((fit-model (solve-data-matrix model-type y x)))
	  (print-model-summary fit-model)
	  (values fit-model model-type y x)))	
	
The idea is that if you were just introducing a new type of model (say
GLM as opposed to LM) you might only need to rewrite the
solve-data-matrix method for your new model type (as long as your
interface for the fit model type was sufficiently well defined).  But
you might need to rewrite the generic function to handle something
more complex (like multiple imputation) even though you could still
call some of the same component functions.

Probably the best place to read about this kind of thinking is in the
book "The Art of the Metaobject Protocol" by Gregor Kiczales, Jime Des
Rivieres and Daniel Bobrow.


    My "lisp logic" tells me not to expect any difference in performance 
  in the default case where "user-lineplot-proto" is just an alias to
  scatterplot-proto, but I haven't tested this. [ BTW: *Is* there an
  overhead associated with the depth of inheritance in classes ? Is there
  any performance reason to prefer flatter class hierarchies ? ] 


My feeling for xlisp-stat was that most of the method dispatch was
handled at run-time, unlike CLOS where quite a bit was done at compile
time, especially if you carefully declared all of the variables.
(John Macdonald wrote some code in CLOS which was as fast or faster
than similar code in Fortran:  he just needed to make all of the
declarations which were required in Fortran and optional in Lisp.)

On the other hand, the performance overhead is just an extra method
call (or in the case of a deeply nested hierarchy a linear search
through the class heirarchy).  You need to weigh performance versus
the need for code re-use.  On modern machines programmer time is
usually more expensive than CPU cycles.

Hello Folks-

I have two questions.  First, is the list archived, and if so, how can I 
view it?

Secondly, how can I view the original code for graph-proto?  I want to 
make a special graph and need to alter some things.  I have search the 
.lsp files that came with my distribution, but have not found the code.

One thing I would like to do for example would be to have a histogram 
with frequncies along the ticks of the y-axis rather than the proportion.

Thanks-
Dan

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Precedence: bulk

I have run into a curious lispish thing in fitting a regression
model (also GLIMs) when I include both a quantitative variable, say
dose, and a category, say prep.  In order to include the category
I can use the (indicators prep) command to create the indicator
variables for prep.  What you get is a list where each element is
a list.  For example:

dose
(3.4 5.2 7.0 8.5 10.5 13 18 21 28 6.5 10 14 21.5 29)
> prep
(STD STD STD STD STD STD STD STD STD TEST TEST TEST TEST TEST)
> (indicators prep)
((0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1))

If I want now to fit a logistic model to this data, I would
naively do the following:

(binomialreg-model (append dose (indicators prep)) r n)

for
> r
(0 5 11 14 18 21 23 30 27 2 10 18 21 27)
and
> n
(33 32 38 37 40 37 31 37 30 40 30 40 35 37)

But when I do I get the error:
Error: dimensions do not match
Happened in: #<Byte-Code-Closure: #8c266ee8>

But, of course, if I define dose so that it is a list with its one
element a list, everything works out fine, i.e.

(def dose-2 '((3.4 5.2 7.0 8.5 10.5 13 18 21 28 6.5 10 14 21.5 29)))

(binomialreg-model (append dose-2 (indicators prep)) r n)

then everything works fine.  Can anyone tell me a better way to define
the dose so that I don't have to create dose-2 as I did above or a 
better way to define the indicator variables for prep?  

(I realize that prep, with only 2 levels, can be coded easily without 
using the indicators command, but I would like be able to use it for 
a variable with an arbitrary number of levels)

Thanks as always!

Jeff

Let me be the first to comment on my question by realizing that
I left off the link structure, so that the model statements should
read:
(binomialreg-model (append dose (indicators prep)) r n
	:link logit-link)

Wouldn't want to confuse anyone :>)  Sorry!

Subject: HOW-TO? Problem relating to spin-plots
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk

Hi,

I am trying to build some way of interpreting a mouse-click on a plot that
returns the location (in real coordinates, i.e. w.r.t. the data of the
plot, not canvas coordinates) of the click.

For scatter-plots this is a pretty simple matter, I override the do-click
method and use the graph-proto :canvas-to-real method to work out the
scaling from canvas coordinates to real coordinates.  However the problem
is considerably more difficult with spin-plots because of their 3-D nature,
and the fact that we view them as 3-d objects projected onto a 2-d screen.

In the simplest case consider a spin-plot where the view point is parallel
to the z axis through the origin (exactly the view you see when you create
a spin-plot inititally), I will call this view point V.  A mouse-click can
be interpreted as the projection of a line parallel to the z-axis, where
the line is of the form z = ax + by.  Specifically if a click occurs at
(10, 20), say, in canvas coordiantes, we can transform these to say (5, 10)
in real coordinates using :canvas-to-real method. Now we can correctly
state that the point clicked represents a line from the point (5, 10,
-infinity) to the point (5, 10, +infinity).

Things get hairy when we allow (as XLispStat so nicely does) the plot to be
rotated on each axis.  Our line now takes the form z = ax + by + c.  I want
to be able to calculate the intersection of the line with the each axis
(allowing for the possibility that the line is parallel to any axis).  How
should I approach this problem can anyone tell me?

I do notice that spin-plots only alow a fixed and equal aspect ratio so
this makes the canvas to real coordinates conversion a lot simpler (i.e. a
canvas ordinate will scale to the same real ordinate be it on the x, y or z
plane).  I guess we can consider our line as of the form z = ax + by, then
calculate some sort of transformation T which will move the view point from
V to V', where T is the transformation that encapsulates all rotations that
have occured to the plot from its initial state.  Then apply this
transformation to our line, somehow.  How can I work out what rotations
have occured so far to our spin-plot?  How can I apply a transformation to
a line?  I guess a lot of this stuff is handled in the internals of
spin-proto and the solution lies within (or is this wishful thinking??).

I hope I've stated my problem in an understandable fashion, Any views,
comments (or code, even better!!) would be greatly appreciated!!

		Cheers,

Obviously you can't click on an arbitrary point of the canvas and hope for
its 3-D coordinates because a whole line corresponds to that point.

What you can hope for (says he without getting his hands dirty ... ) is to
be able to click AT or NEAR a data point, and get the 3-D coordinates
(or some other label) of the data-point which is plotted nearest to the
mouse-click.

For that, the required info is in there somewhere: in fact, of course, you
can already select data-points in a spin-plot (e.g. start the demo
"xlispstat tourdemo" and, when the iris data come up, draw a box round some
of the plotted points on the canvas; these then get highlighted and if you
then rotate the plot the highlighted points rotate).

So xlispstat KNOWS. I don't know how to ask it for the info, though. Yet.

Best wishes,
Ted.                                    (Ted.Harding@nessie.mcc.ac.uk)

Yup, I already realise this, but this is beyond what I am looking for, what
I want is the parameters to the line equation z = ax + by + c which
describes the infinitely long line on which the point where I clicked must
exist.

What I hope to do is to calculate the range boundries of a rectangle drawn
upon a spin-plot, i.e.

    "selection range = ((c1 < x < c2) & (c3 < y < c4) & (c5 < z < c6))"

       where c1..cn are constants in range -infinity to +infinity,  and
before anyone says it (just let all constants equal -/+ infinity, problem
solved!) I want to be as precise as possible.  I have thought of, and
implemented, a method which uses the values of the selected points (i.e.
the points within the rectangle drawn on the spin-plot) to calculate the
minimum bounding cube of the selection, but this does not describe exactly
what is drawn, nor does it work for selections containing no points.

I got several requests for a summary of responses to a recent request
for information re S-plus v xlisp-stat, so here it is.

One of the posts mentions a program called R as having something of the
flavour of S, but not being available in Windows. I'm not familiar with
R, but along these lines I would suggest the program 'MacAnova'
(http://www.stat.umn.edu/~gary/macanova/macanova.home.html). Despite the
name, it's also available for other platforms. It's a great program.

Which reminds me... I'd like to publicly thank those who develop and
extend fine freely-available software such as xlisp-stat and MacAnova.
May lots of good things come your way.

My original post follows, and then the replies. Thanks again to all who
replied.

Generally, I think the comparisons of S-plus and XLS have been
fair. Also, there is one in Statistical Science some time ago.
Although we have both, the five major and overriding reasons
why I would not even consider using S-plus are perhaps worth repeating.

(a) XLS comes with complete source code -- in ANSI C. Generally it
    is a breeze to port it to a new flavor of UNIX. It is quite
    easy to extend it at compile time, and by now it is also
    easy to extend it at runtime with object code. One can always
    go back to the source in case of doubt. One can look at the
    source and marvel.

(b) XLS runs on the Mac, in fact that is where both XLS and I
    prefer to be most of the time. The other two are just necessary
    evils.

(c) I can give it away to my students and my family, in unlimited
    quantities, and for their own home computers, no matter what
    hardware and OS they have. I can provide WWW interfaces to
    the program which run for free from the web servers -- I dont
    think the S-plus people would appreciate a similar service.

(d) Porting from Common Lisp is now easy. Porting from FORTRAN
    to CL, and then to XL is now easy. Lisp is a general purpose
    language. There are lots of books on Lisp. Lisp is a beautiful
    language. Because of XLS I now read books such as "On Lisp"
    or Norvig or Steele.

(e) Dynamic graphics for demos, instructional modules, and research
    tools cannot really be done in S. Computing and making static
    plots is perhaps marginally easier in S, but this is not what
    I do.

Subject: Re: S-plus and xlisp-stat


Here are a couple of the major differences:

1) Graphics Engine.

One of the biggest drawbacks of S is that it still has a plotter based
graphics package.  I find S easier to use for fancy static graphics
with lots of overlays.  Xlisp-stat's big advantage comes from its
ability to support dynamic graphics.

2) Memory model

S stores data objects on disc while XLS stores them in memory.  One
consequence is that S storage is persistent.  XLS should also be
faster with some operations as a consequence, but S will handle larger
data sets (although with the price of memory, thats not as much of a
problem as it used to be).

3) Programming Ease

I'd say this one is a toss-up.  S has a more C-like syntax for those
who have a mental block about parentheses. S also has a truely bizarre
object model (class identity and method dispatch are completely
divorced from object encapsulation.)  Also, I find the S lazy
evaluation harder to understand than the Lisp eager evaluation rules.

Unfortunately, xlisp lacks many of the debugging tools which makes
Lisp so easy to use.

(Which reminds me, did I ever post my debugging code to the list?)

4) Functionality

S-Plus definetly has more, and more thorough testing.  Both
collections of functions reflect the research interestsof their
respective authors:  S tends to favor robust procedures and XLS
Bayesian.  On the other hand, if you really need a specific function,
try SAS.

5) Support

Luke does a great job for a one man show, but part of the price of
S-Plus is the ability to call somebody on the phone to hold your hand
while you go through the mysteries of configuring S-Plus to work on
your PC with your printer.  Also, there are training couses
available.

6) Price

XLS costs fewer dollars, but morein sweat equity.  Thus, it tends to
be favored by researchers and teachers who are willing to put in the
effort to get it to do what they want.

I've been an SPlus user for several years, but have only started working
with xlisp-stat recently. What attracted me to xlisp-stat was:

(1) the ease with which you can use it to develop and prototype dynamic
graphics.
(2) Its open and extensible architecture;
(3) The price is right;
(4) I once took a course in LISP (you don't need to know LISP to use
xlisp-stat.  I'm just fond of OOP languages!)

Splus has a _huge_ number of objects, and the pile seems to grow daily.
xlisp-stat is not exactly lacking in the area of built-in fuctions: check
out Luke Tierney's 1990 book (Wiley), and you'll see what I mean! I'd say
the learning curve for Splus is steeper than for xlisp-stat, but some
would
disagree.

I'm not sure what you mean by "more flexible." Since Splus has so many
functions, it may reduce programming effort if the functions are what you
need.

A 32-bit MS Windows version of SPlus is still being beta-tested.  It
should
be available later this year (June, maybe?).  A 32 bit version of
xlisp-stat has been available for a bit.

Hope the above is some help,

Well, I'm not very familiar with them on Windows, but I've used both.

I think your impression is basically correct.


S-plus is a higher-level, user-oriented language, with a lot of
statistical

procedures built in -- it's an interactive statictics application.

LispStat is more flexible, but  not as complete or polished. It's a
language
for writing interactive statictical applications or for experimenting with
new types of interactive statictical graphics.



If you want to do something "standard", it's going to be easier in S-plus.

If you want to try to do something new or not supported in S-plus, it's
probably
going to be easier in LispStat.



S-plus has several good books about using it for doing statistics.
But the documentation on how to really customize it is a bit thin.

 LispStat documentation is thinner in general, but it's more programmer
oriented. Plus, it's Lisp - for which there is plenty of books, tutorials,
&
documentation.


The above is a wild and subjective generalization, but I don't think it's
too far
off the mark.  I did quite a bit of evaluation of them both before
launching on
a project -- I can't swear that what I wanted to do was impossible to do
in
S-plus,
but if it was possible, there were no examples or documentation to guide
me

in that sort of low level programming.

Couldn't be more right, actually.  I use both on a Unix platform.
Lisp-Stat's ease of programming and graphics capabilities allow me to
experiment and devise new graphing techniques, but its lack of stat
functions is a weak spot.  Conversely, S-plus has routines that are
hard to match in terms of numerical accuracy, speed and range of
applications.  S-plus has great graphics, but linking information in
graphs and coloring are too difficult given S-plus's copy-everything
style.  Fortunately in Unix I can pass commands off to a background
S-plus process, and pipe the results back into LispStat for graphing.
Best of both worlds.  I'm not sure if this is doable in Windows95 yet,
but the day is approaching.

I do use S-plus in the Windows environment, it is still a great
package running under Windows95.  I tried LispStat under windows3.1
but the 20,000 byte stack was easily overwhelmed by any reasonable
recursive lisp function.  I haven't tried LispStat 3.48 under
Windows95, but supposedly Windows95 has a bigger, or unlimited stack.
You can also make calls to Windows API functions to talk between
applications, (I do this in Visual Basic but haven't tried it under
LispStat).  Soon our day will come...

Xlisp-Stat is more flexible graphically (particularly for producing
dynamic graphics where it is easy to link plots, add slider controls and
so on).  It is also much much faster.  The quality of the printed graphics
is substantially inferior to S-Plus but there is an interface to the
gnuplot program that produces high-quality printed output. The fact that
it is a dialect of LISP makes it harder to learn initially.  Another
advantage of lispstat, not relevant to you, is that it runs on Macs and on
Linux, the free Unix clone. S-PLUS will not run on Macs or on any Unix or
Unix clone for Intel chips.

S-PLUS has, as you observed, oodles of built-in functions.  It is
probably easier to learn.  More people program their favorite new ideas
in S-PLUS than any other language. I use S-PLUS for most data analysis.

People *are* starting to write built-in functions for xlispstat. For
example,
I have written code for Generalised Estimating Equations and for Cox
regression. Still, I would say that the main markets for lispstat are
teaching (because of the dynamic graphics and because students can run it
at home for no cost) and quick-and-dirty simulations (for which S is
prohitively slow but xlispstat is fast enough that the saving in
programmer time over C/FORTRAN is worthwhile).

My impression is pretty much the same as yours. Another distinction is,
of
course,  that xlisp-stat is public domain,  whereas S-plus is not. Oh -
and
I don't think there is a Mac version of S-plus.  Although you specifically
mention Windows versions the last point could be important if any code you
create is to be shared among others using non-PC hardware.

(Sorry I accidentally deleted the original posting so I can't quite
site it.)

But the thrust of the question was how to take two variable data
structures, dose and (indicator response), and build them into a
structure that could be passed to binomial-reg (or some similar
function).  

The answer is the list function

(binomial-reg (list dose (indicator response)) n r :link
binomial-link) 

[or something like that, I deleted the original post and haven't
looked up the functions] should do what you want.
In any case, (list dose (indicator response)) will yeild the data
structure you need a list of two elements the first being the list
dose and the second being the list returned from (indicator response).

It become slightly trickier if you need to build up a data frame (to
use the S terminology) type structure from a combination of variable
vectors and other data frames.  In that case, you would need to write
your own analog of the S cbind function.  Something like:

(defun cbind (first &rest data)
  "This function merges a number of items which could be variables
  (lists of values) or data matrixes (lists of lists of values)."
  (unless (listp first)
	(error "cbind: Expected a list, got ~S" first))
  (let (result)
    (if (listp (car first))
        ;; First is a data matrix 
	(setf result (copy-list first))  ; We are going to
                                         ; destructively modify this
                                         ; list so better copy it
      ;; First is just a data vector
      (setf result (list first)))
    (apply #'cbind-aux result (last result) data)))

(defun cbind-aux (result result-last first &rest data)
  ;; Properly tail recursive version of cbind
  (unless (listp first)
	(error "cbind: Expected a list, got ~S" first))
  (let (new-result)
    (if (listp (car first))
        ;; First is a data matrix
	(setf result (copy-list first))  ; copy so we can destroy it
      ;; First is just a data vector
      (setf result (list first)))
    ;; result-last is a pointer to the last cons cell of result so we
    ;; don't need to do implicit looping to append.
    (setf (cdr result-last) new-result)
    (if (null data) result      ; End condition
      (apply #'cbind-aux result (last new-result) data))))


I think you might be able to get away with something less obscure in
xlisp because I don't think the compiler does tail recursion
optimization.

Hope this helps.

You can get/set the current transformation matrix from a spin plot 
with the :transformation method. 

The following ALMOST draws a line into the plane. 
Sometimes I get a point visible and sometimes I get a short line segment. 
Perhaps this is due to round off or some other truncation. 
But when you rotate or spin the plot, it looks approximately correct. 
( I just hacked this out and minimally tested it manually -- you can
  hook it into do-click to get it to work automatically. I just made
  :do-click report the canvas (x,y) and I typed them in manually. ) 

Change the -1, 1  Z values to make it longer. I was testing it on a 
range ( -3 3 ) spin plot, so that was a convenient test value. 
[ Does a really large z value get you into greater roundoff problems? ] 


( defmeth s :zline ( cx cy &key (color 'red))
  ( let* (( real-xy ( send self :canvas-to-real cx cy ))
          ( real-x ( car real-xy ))
          ( real-y ( cadr real-xy ))
          ( transmat ( send self :transformation ))
          ( v1 ( matmult ( vector real-x real-y -1 ) transmat ))
          ( v2 ( matmult ( vector real-x real-y 1 ) transmat )))
    ( send s :add-lines 
           ( map 'cons #'list v1 v2 ) :color color )))



The more general question about how to pick or input 3-d points or lines 
is an interesting one. Gestural input would be nice to experiment with,
but this may be difficult with the current XLispStat graphics
implementation.

This doesn't quite work because indicator returns a list of lists
(indicators for k categories require k-1 lists of 1s and 0s). Two things
which do work are:
(cons dose (indicator response))
(append (list dose) (indicator response))

Some of the graphic code is in the xlispstat C sources -- you can look
at the various iview* files. Some of the code is in xlisp, and is mostly
in graphics.lsp, graph2.lsp,. graph3.lsp. 

There are a lot of contributed modules that will give you some hints 
of how to do extensions. ( They are probably a better place to start
than the sources) I know there are a couple of alternate histogram
implementations -- maybe one of them already does what you want. 


[ And again, I have lots of code for doing real-space, colored overlay
  graphics objects and some other things on 
 http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/  among the XES application
 sources. I have updated the files there recently, and will do so again
 today, but the documentation now lags behind the sources. ]

I'm not sure it's quite exactly right, but it'll get you started
in the right direction.  ( It looks to me like there is more 
than a roundoff problem. You might have to look at the C code
to see what's really expected by the transformations. )

It appears that if you check NO SCALING in the Spinner Menu
Options dialog, then that procedure works perfectly - it will 
draw a line into the screen Z-axis at the canvas x,y coordinates 
clicked. It will be only be visible, on end as a dot, until you
rotate the plot. 

 With Scaling ON ( either the Fixed or Variable option on ), 
there is clearly another step to the transform besides the
canvas-to-real and matmult by the transformation matrix.
 
  Anyone know how to reverse that effect ?

Hi,

Th function "spin-function" does not work properly on
the version 3.48 and 3.49.
For example, in the Tierney's textboook we can find
the function f(x)=x^2+y^2. But we cannot obtain the
picture as appeared in p. 60.

Hi ...

In the 3.44 distribution (I havn't checked more recent ones) there is a
file named xlisp.hlp, which I had always assumed was what contained the
data for the (help ...) function.

Now I discover (help ...) works without the xlisp.hlp file.

So...what is this file for?

Announcing a major new release of
ViSta - The Visual Statistics System
For Unix, MSWindows and MacOS
Version 4.27, March 14th, 1997
Copyright (c) 1991-97 by Forrest W. Young

This new release brings major new (and improved) data analysis and
visualization methods to ViSta for Unix, updating it to the capabilities of
ViSta for MSWindows and MacOS. It also adds Data Simulation, with an
optional Central Limit Theorem visualization. This release is available for
all three platforms, unifying the code for the first time.

ViSta is available for free for Microsoft Windows, MacOS, and for Unix with
X11. ViSta and its documentation are available from our WWW and FTP servers
at:
   WWW: http://forrest.psych.unc.edu/research/vista.html
   FTP:  ftp://www.psych.unc.edu/pub/forrest/vista/

ViSta is also mirrored in Australia, Austria, United Kingdom, and USA at
   http://ssda.anu.edu.au/mirrors/ViSta.html (Australia)
   http://sunsite.univie.ac.at/ViSta (Austria)
   http://micros.hensa.ac.uk/mirrors/vista (UK - ac.uk only 8AM-8PM GMT)
   http://www.psych.unc.edu/fwy/research (USA)
The new release will not be available on the Australian mirror for a few days.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
ViSta features visual tools for understanding data structure, for seeing
the results of statistical analyses; for guiding the analyst during an
analysis session; and for structuring the analyst's data analysis process.
ViSta is designed for a wide range of users. It is particularly useful for
those learning statistics and for their teachers.

ViSta is being used to teach introductory statistics; introductory and
advanced multivariate statistics; statistical graphics; and computational
statistics. ViSta is also being used for research and development in
statistical graphics and computational statistics.

ViSta is designed for an audience of users having a very wide range of data
analysis sophistication, ranging from novice to expert. ViSta provides
seamlessly integrated data analysis environments specifically tailored to
the user's level of expertise. Guidance is available for students and
novices, and tools are available for teachers and other experts to create
guidance for these novices. A structured graphical user interface is
available for competent users, and a command line interface is available
for sophisticated users. The complete Lisp-Stat (Tierney, 1990) programming
environment is available to researchers, programmers and graduate students
who wish to extend ViSta's capabilities.

ViSta performs univariate and multivariate statistical data analysis and
visualization. ViSta's data analysis and visualization capabilities
include: exploratory graphics and descriptive statistics; univariate tests
and visualizations; analysis of variance; regression analysis; principal
components analysis; multidimensional scaling and correspondence analysis.
All analysis methods have extensive visualization features.

NEW FEATURES FOR ALL PLATFORMS:
   1) Data can be simulated by sampling from any of 10 hypothetical
population distributions.
   2) The data simulation feature includes an optional visualization which
interactively demonstrates the central limit theorem. A click of the mouse
generates one (or several) new samples whose means and standard deviations
are added to histograms of their sampling distributions.
   3) Part of the code is provided as compiled byte-code for MSWindows and
MacOS to improve efficiency.

NEW FEATURES IN ViSta FOR UNIX:
ViSta for Unix now includes all of the features previously available only
in the MSWindows and MacOS  versions. These include:
   1) A new OLS, robust and monotonic regression module.
   2) Redundancy analysis (new option of the multivariate regression module).
   3) Extensive visual regression diagnostics.
   4) A visualization method for Univariate Analysis.
   5) A completed visualization method for Analysis of Variance.
   6) An improved visualization method for Multivariate Regression.
   7) A multivariate regression test.
Minor changes made in ViSta for Unix which were already made in ViSta for
MacOS and MSWindows, include:
   1) Import Data works with strings as well as symbols and numbers.
   2) Create-Data can remove rows of multivariate data with missing values.
   3) Datasheet menu items now allow adding several obs/vars simultaneously.
   4) Datasheet shows matrix names for matrix data.
   5) Datasheet window scrolling and sizing improved.
In addition, window and dialog layout, input and output file dialog boxes,
graphic fonts, and the exit process have been improved in the Unix version.

BUG FIXES IN ALL VERSIONS:
Several bugs have been fixed in all versions of ViSta. These include:
   1) Data with missing values are imported properly
   2) Data with missing values propagate properly during data management.
   3) There is a new option for row-wise removal of data with missing values.
   4) Summary Statistics are reported for the selected subset of variables.
   5) Univariate Analysis performed on the selected numeric variable.
   6) Univariate Analysis reports correct confidence intervals.
   7) Regression Analysis added variable plot now has an X-axis button.
   8) Regression Analysis module does robust regression when requested in
the dialog box.

Sorry I haven't got back earlier, thanks to Steve Majewski and Ted Harding
for their input. I have been playing around with Steve Majewski's code
which works nicely for spin-plots with 'no scaling' selected in the options
menu item.  I've rewritten Steve's code slightly to make investigation a
little easier (below).  I've noticed that when you switch from 'variable
scaling' to 'No scaling', the code is prone to some sort of errors, i.e.
the lines are placed exactly at the required point, and somtimes are not
completely orthogonal to the viewing plane.

However if you switch from 'fixed scaling' to 'no scaling', the code seems
to work fine.  In fact if you switch from 'Variable scaling' to 'fixed
scaling' and then to 'no scaling' it works fine also, STRANGE!  Maybe this
might shine some light on what is going on internally?

Thanks to Steve, I will continue to tinker with this problem on my 'long
coffee breaks' and let you know if I come up with anything!  I hope you
will do likewise?

	Thanks for the help,
				Dom.

xlispstat 3.50 is now the standard distribution. It is available in

	ftp://ftp.stat.umn.edu/pub/xlispstat

This release fixes bugs found in 3.49.

There is a good chance that this will be the final release to include
a Win16 version. I may also cut back the Macintosh distribution to a
PPC version and a single 68K version for 020 processors and a
coprocessor (SoftFPU will allow this to run on systems without
coprocessors). Please let me know if this would cause serious
problems.

The thing to check is: 
 ( send plot :scale ( send plot :current-variables ))

When these are all approximately equal to 1.0, then the code works,
no mater which option is set.  It looks like no-scaling forces it to 
(1.0 1.0 1.0).  What the scaling is equal to for the other options depends
on some other factors, especially the range of the values in the plot. 


[ One of my first test spin-plots happened to be unit-ranged in all 
dimensions, so the scales factors were all close to 1.0 for all scale
options - 
this kept me from noticing the scale effect at first. ]


It should be possible to put the scale factor into that code and have
something that works for all cases. I just haven't yet been able to figure
out what the inverse scale function is -- is it applied to the real or the
canvas
values ?

OK -- Try the following code.

In addition to a :scale, there is also a :shift that has to be corrected
for.
I found this by hunt and peck experimenting, with a bit of peeking at the 
sources, however, I haven't figured out the whole flow of control for these
modules from the sources, so it's mostly what works experimentally. I can't
for the life of me imagine why I have to *both* divide and multiply by the 
scales in 2 different places.  

Shift option clicking will draw a red line segment orthogonal to the 
viewing plane.

To users of ViSta for Windows:

Regarding the recently released new version of ViSta for Windows:  A user
has pointed out that the program group icon that is created for ViSta for
Windows does not properly point to the ViSta executable.

The problem is that the installation process creates a file called
VISTA.EXE, but the program group is expecting a file named WXLS.EXE.

I will fix this in the near future.

In the meantime, you can either change the name of the VISTA.EXE program to
be WXLS.EXE, or you can change the properties of the program group icon to
call VISTA.EXE instead of WXLS.EXE when the icon is double-clicked.

Sorry about the problem.

OK - This one works the same, but it makes slightly more sense.

If you change to :CANVAS-TO-REAL  to :CANVAS-TO-SCALED, then the 
extra division by scale factors is not required. ( And I'm starting to
figure out the transformation steps that must be used in the plots. )

If you wish, you can use the files you have already downloaded and either
1) ignore the program group (especially under Win95, where it is superfluous);
2) change the name of the VISTA.EXE program to be WXLS32.EXE (or

What is the status of the implementation of the c-char, c-float, c-(etc),
data types. Has anyone actually tried using these for interfacing to
native C routines ? 

Luke: Do you have any plans in the works to adapt the dynload routines
to use these datatypes ? 

I would like to pass large arrays of floats, ints and chars to dynamically
loaded code modules. Looking at the current interface, I see that that
is some copying and translation from Lisp <> C-types. This is what I would
like to get rid of, as well as provide a more flexible interface. 

Anyone have any ideas on what a better Lisp->C API should look like?

I have a version of the foreign fcn interface which passes data
directly when it can (as opposed to copying it first).  This would be
for typed vectors, which are basically C arrays internally.

For example, (make-array 100 :element-type 'c-double) makes a typed
array.

The only tricky part is to keep things in this form.  If you use
vectorized operations to add two typed vectors, the result is no
longer typed.

I've been using it to speed up nonlinear optimizations - I have the
objective function coded in fortran.  I link it in & call it with
large arrays as arguments.  My ffi version avoids all the copying &
garbage collection that the native version does, and thus greatly
speeds up the optimizations.

I can email it to you if you're interested.

The basic plan is to build a low level FFI that passes data directly
to C routines and to reimplement the current facilities using the new
low level interface. But it is likely to be a number of months before
I get to that point.

Two notes for ViSta users:

1) A user discovered that the help files for ViSta for Unix were formatted
improperly. If you already have ViSta for Unix, you can download only the
reformatted help files from the ViSta home page. The entire download module
has also been fixed for those downloading ViSta for Unix in the future.

2) The Australian mirror has still not updated its files to include the new
release. I will let you know when they do.

Hello,

In a version of matrix multiplication for sparse matrices
I need to define an array of certain length multiple times.

To speed up the process, I would like to define such an 
array once, after which I "point to this "reference" array:

(let* (x refarray))

However, doing so, causes refarray to take on the value of
x. "why" and " how do I prevent this" are my questions.

I have a new (alpha) version of code for cox regression models.  It now
handles arbitrary time-dependent covariates (ie anything you can write a 
function to specify). 

Also new: tests of proportional hazards assumption based on scaled 
Schoenfeld residuals (as in survival4 for S).

What you want is 
 (let* ((x refarray))
	more code
	)

ie, more parentheses.

Subject: barchart class (part 1 of 3)

Hi,
	while working on some code that will form part of my Ph.D. thesis I
had to build a BarChart class that provided all the standard facilities of
the built in graph types such as histogram.  There are several
implementations of barcharts available for XLISP-STAT but most provided a
limited subset of the functionality of the built in plots.

I came up with a histogram subclass that kinda hacks a histogram so it
looks like a barchart, and then draw labels on the bins.  You can do most
everything with the barchart that you can do with a histogram such as
brushing and selecting, hiding and focusing on selections and so on.  The
interface is practically the same as with the histogram, execpt you can use
non-numeric data, e.g.

    (barchart '(foo bar foo foo bar bar foobar foo foobar bar 1 1 2 3 3 3))

You may notice that the standard slicer menu option is not provided under
the barchart menu, as using a slicer doesn't really make sense with
categorical data anyway.

With this implementation you are limited to at most 24 different categories
of data (as we are limited to  50 bins in a histogram).  This should still
prove useful for many datasets though.

One difficulty arose to do with scaling and rounding which could leave two
bins contiguous - a considerable amount of the code will automatically
recognise and rectify this problem by resizing the plot until the problem
'goes away'.  You may notice this happening when you resize plots, i.e.
they appear to grow again!

A nice touch is the ability to use vertical labels which reduces screen
clutter and label overlapping.

The source is divided into two files, the first is my standard set of
utilities and the second is the barchart class which uses the utility
functions heavily.  If my utility functions cause too many identifier
clashes with other peoples code then please let me know and I will see
about building them into the class itself or using more standard lisp
identifiers.

			enjoy,

				Dom.

;
;;OVERVIEW:
;;   The primary function in the code below is to produce a well-integrated
;;   barchart type plot to XLisp-Stat.  Other implementations of barcharts
;;   are designed to provide basic barchart facilities only, and lack many
;;   of the features of the built-in plots.
;;
;;   My barchart-proto is implemented as a subclass of histogram-proto
;;   and I have tried to implement the package as closely to the standard
;;   histogram interface as possible.
;;
;;   Essentially a barchart of say, 5 categories is built using a histogram
;;   of 9 bins, with every second bin containing zero elements.  My code then
;;   adds labels to each bin, the label being the value of the category.
;;
;;
;;USAGE:
;;   Use in a similar manner to histogram except barchart accepts non-numeric
;;   data.  e.g.
;;
;;   >(barchart '(foo bar foobar foo bar foo 1 1 2 3 "foo" "FOOBAR"))
;;
;;   This produces a barchart with the following categories:
;;					'(1 2 3 BAR FOO FOOBAR foo)
;;
;;   (note that it converts all elements to strings so foobar is equivalent to
;;   "FOOBAR").
;;
;;   In physically small barcharts or barcharts with a lot of categories labels
;;   can obscure each other so I have provided an option to switch to
vertically
;;   oriented labels.  Select Options... from the Barchart menu when the
;;   barchart is the active window and click on the Vertical Labels checkbox.
;;
;;
;;ADVANTAGES:
;;   Has all features of standard plots including selecting and brushing,
;;   linking, hiding/focusing selections, selection colors, and plot options.
;;
;;
;;DISADVANTAGES:
;;   Limited to 25 categories
;;
;;
;;KNOWN PROBLEMS
;;   A problem with to do with scaling/rounding errors that occurs when the
;;	 the barchart is resized to a very small size, or when the barchart
;;   contains a lot of categories could leave two contiguous non-empty bars.
;;   A fix simply tests for this problem and then resizes the barchart until
;;   the problem 'goes away'.  Certain other functions which call the plot
;;   method :adjust-to-data may also cause the graph size to be adjusted
;;   slightly under certain circumstances.

Subject: barchart class (part 1 of 3)
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu

Hi,
	while working on some code that will form part of my Ph.D. thesis I
had to build a BarChart class that provided all the standard facilities of
the built in graph types such as histogram.  There are several
implementations of barcharts available for XLISP-STAT but most provided a
limited subset of the functionality of the built in plots.

I came up with a histogram subclass that kinda hacks a histogram so it
looks like a barchart, and then draw labels on the bins.  You can do most
everything with the barchart that you can do with a histogram such as
brushing and selecting, hiding and focusing on selections and so on.  The
interface is practically the same as with the histogram, execpt you can use
non-numeric data, e.g.

    (barchart '(foo bar foo foo bar bar foobar foo foobar bar 1 1 2 3 3 3))

You may notice that the standard slicer menu option is not provided under
the barchart menu, as using a slicer doesn't really make sense with
categorical data anyway.

With this implementation you are limited to at most 24 different categories
of data (as we are limited to  50 bins in a histogram).  This should still
prove useful for many datasets though.

One difficulty arose to do with scaling and rounding which could leave two
bins contiguous - a considerable amount of the code will automatically
recognise and rectify this problem by resizing the plot until the problem
'goes away'.  You may notice this happening when you resize plots, i.e.
they appear to grow again!

A nice touch is the ability to use vertical labels which reduces screen
clutter and label overlapping.

The source is divided into two files, the first is my standard set of
utilities and the second is the barchart class which uses the utility
functions heavily.  If my utility functions cause too many identifier
clashes with other peoples code then please let me know and I will see
about building them into the class itself or using more standard lisp
identifiers.

			enjoy,

				Dom.

;;
;;   If you have any bug reports, suggestions or comments about this code,
;;   or if you have suggestions on how to improve it, please let me know
;;   via email.  Also, if you find this code useful, I'd appreciate your
;;   letting me know that as well.
;;
;;   This code has only been tested on non Power Mac platforms so I am unsure

;
;;OVERVIEW:
;;   The primary function in the code below is to produce a well-integrated
;;   barchart type plot to XLisp-Stat.  Other implementations of barcharts
;;   are designed to provide basic barchart facilities only, and lack many
;;   of the features of the built-in plots.
;;
;;   My barchart-proto is implemented as a subclass of histogram-proto
;;   and I have tried to implement the package as closely to the standard
;;   histogram interface as possible.
;;
;;   Essentially a barchart of say, 5 categories is built using a histogram
;;   of 9 bins, with every second bin containing zero elements.  My code then
;;   adds labels to each bin, the label being the value of the category.
;;
;;
;;USAGE:
;;   Use in a similar manner to histogram except barchart accepts non-numeric
;;   data.  e.g.
;;
;;   >(barchart '(foo bar foobar foo bar foo 1 1 2 3 "foo" "FOOBAR"))
;;
;;   This produces a barchart with the following categories:
;;					'(1 2 3 BAR FOO FOOBAR foo)
;;
;;   (note that it converts all elements to strings so foobar is equivalent to
;;   "FOOBAR").
;;
;;   In physically small barcharts or barcharts with a lot of categories labels
;;   can obscure each other so I have provided an option to switch to
vertically
;;   oriented labels.  Select Options... from the Barchart menu when the
;;   barchart is the active window and click on the Vertical Labels checkbox.
;;
;;
;;ADVANTAGES:
;;   Has all features of standard plots including selecting and brushing,
;;   linking, hiding/focusing selections, selection colors, and plot options.
;;
;;
;;DISADVANTAGES:
;;   Limited to 25 categories
;;
;;
;;KNOWN PROBLEMS
;;   A problem with to do with scaling/rounding errors that occurs when the
;;	 the barchart is resized to a very small size, or when the barchart
;;   contains a lot of categories could leave two contiguous non-empty bars.
;;   A fix simply tests for this problem and then resizes the barchart until
;;   the problem 'goes away'.  Certain other functions which call the plot
;;   method :adjust-to-data may also cause the graph size to be adjusted
;;   slightly under certain circumstances.

;; A set of utility functions and constants

;;DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT:
;;
;;            Machine:	PowerMac 7200/90
;;   Operating system:	MacOS 7.5.5
;;         XLISP-STAT:  3.50 Beta (PowerMac Binary)
;;
;;
;;SOURCE CODE
;;   Source code is optimised for a 4 space tab width and indented according
;;   to my own personal preferences (sorry, I know hardened lisp'ers will hate
;;   it, so pretty print it! 8)
;;
;;
;;COMMENTS:
;;   Users are free to use this code, UNMODIFIED, in their packages, provided
;;   they clearly acknowledge it's use and credit the author.
;;
;;   If you have any bug reports, suggestions or comments about this code,
;;   or if you have suggestions on how to improve it, please let me know
;;   via email.  Also, if you find this code useful, I'd appreciate your
;;   letting me know that as well.
;;
;;   This code has only been tested on non Power Mac platforms so I am unsure
;;   as to how well or badly it performs on Windows/Unix boxes.
;;   Comments from "beta testers" for these platforms are especially welcome.
;;
;;
;;							Enjoy,
;;
	Dom.

;;
;;OVERVIEW:
;;   The primary aim of the code below is to provide clearer constants,
;;   and utility functions to make coding simpler and code more readable.
;;   These functions are general in nature and can be used by a wide range
;;   of packages.  I hope the identifiers used don't clash with other
;;   people's code.
;;
;;   Note: In speed-critical areas some functions may impede performance
;;         where used

Here's my weekend lisp exercise for all you die-hards out there
who can't find anything to do outside (it's finally going to be
warm here in Upstate so I'll be out fishing)!!

I have a number, call it "initial" and a list call it "counts".
What I would like to do is create a new list where the first element
is "initial" and each sucessive element is divided by 2 say.  This is
continued until the new list is the same length as "counts".  That is,
I am creating a list with the serial dilutions of a starting value the
same length as another list.

As always, appreciate any help

That's a nice little problem, I couldn't resist. You could do this:
 
 (def serial-dil (* initial (^ 2 (- 0 (iseq (length counts) )))))

But it would make sense to write it as a function:

 (defun  serial-diltn ( init ct)
        (* init (^ 2  (- 0  (iseq (length ct))))))

> (serial-diltn 120 (iseq 1 10))

Hello.

I would like to change a number to the corresponding string.
For example, 1 <=> "1" , 2<=>"2", ...
Some times I need the string such as "c1", "c2", ...

How can I create the string "c*"?

I'm having troubles with calling an external program on the Windows
version of XLS, I wonder if anyone has a better solution that the 
one I came up with.  

THe problem is that I call an external program to extract data from
a speech database, the data is then written to a text file and 
read in to xls.  On unix this is fine as (system ...) waits for the
command to complete before returning but
on windows (system ...) returns immediately. Hence I have had to hack 
code to sit waiting on the file which is being written to see when it
first of all exists and then when it has stopped growing -- then I 
assume the process has finished and I can read the data:

 
(defun wait-for-file (file) 
    "ARGS: FILE
wait until file exists and has stopped growing. Used to wait until 
another process has finished writing to the file"
    ;; first wait until the file exists or we get bored
    (let ((failed nil))
      (do ((its 0 (1+ its))) 
         ((or (> its 200)(probe-file file))
          (if (> its 200) (setq failed t)))
        (format t "its = ~a\n" its))
    (format t "failed is ~a\n" failed)
    
      (if (not failed)
        ;; then wait for it to stop growing
        (with-open-file (stream file)
            (do ((length 0 (file-length stream))
                 (lastlength 0 length)
                 (sameits 0)
                 (zeroits 0))
                ((or (> zeroits 200) (> sameits 50))
                 (if (> zeroits 200) (setq failed t)))
              (format t "zeroits = ~a, sameits = ~a, length = ~a\n"
              zeroits sameits length)
              ;; if the file is stuck at zero we will wait for 200
              ;; iterations before quiting
              (if (= length 0) (incf zeroits))
              ;; increment count if length is not zero (ie some data has
              ;; been written) and the length is the same as last time
              ;; we will then wait until the length doesn't change for 50
              ;; iterations
              (if (and (> length 0) 
                       (= length lastlength)) 
                (incf sameits)
               (setf sameits 0)))))
       (format t "failed is ~a\n" failed)
       (not failed)))
           

This is of course an inherently falible thing to do -- I have no way of 
knowing if the external call has really completed or just crashed halfway 
through, or it may just take longer than my wait time to begin writing
data.  

This seems to be a problem inherent in WinExec, the fn call used to 
implement (system ...), a quick scan revealed a family of functions (spawn*) 
in the microsoft api which allow the caller to wait on the child process 
-- however they are only available for win32 applications. Apart from 
hacking the source can anyone see a more reliable way of synchronising
the two processes under the current xls system.

Many thanks,

Maybe I misunderstand, but if not, here's a simple solution:

(defun dilutions (initial counts &optional (factor 2))
  (let ((factors (^ factor (iseq (length counts)))))
    (/ initial factors)))

> (def counts (poisson-rand 10 1))
COUNTS
> (dilutions 10 counts)

The (format) function can be made to return, rather than print, a string. 
So:
(def x 1)
(format nil "~a" x)
returns 
"1"
and
(def x (iseq 10))
(mapcar #'(lambda (a) (format nil "c~a" a)) x)
returns the list
("c0" "c2" "c3" ... "c9")

Along the same lines you can turn symbols (like a-symbol) into strings 
(like "a-symbol") with the (symbol-name) function.  This may be 
important if you read a data file that has unquoted character variables 
(which will end up as symbols) and you want them as strings.

Anyone knows a way to do the same in wxls?

I belive wxls has a solution. Any views, comments (or code, even better!!)

Until recently it was produced by SERC, a Seattle company. I understand 
it has just been sold.

There is code to fit generalised linear mixed models by two different 
algorithms at the UCLA archive.  One method is Schall's (equivalent to 
the PQL method of Breslow & Clayton) which is known to perform badly for 
binary data.  The other method is due to Jan de Leeuw, but I don't know 
how it works (or how well).

There is no reason in principle why you couldn't do this in lispstat, but 
I don't think anyone has actually implemented the calculations. 
Programming the numerical integration efficiently would be tedious.

Subject: generation of variables
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu

Hi,

I have a simular type of problem like generation of string:
How I create the variable 'c1 'c2 ... ?
When we use the function "make-color", we assign the
color table to variables.

For example,

(make-color 'c1 1 1 0)

If we can change the variable in the program
depending on the other variable, color change
is easy.

   a>2 => (make-color 'c1 1 1 0)
   1<a=<2  => (make-color 'c2 0 1 1)
   0<a=<1 => (make-color 'c3 1 0 1)
   .
   .
   .
On the macintosh the function "free-color" does not work
properly.  Once we assign a color to the variable, we
cannot change the color.  This is a bug.  Therefore,
it is very convenient to generate the variable.

The magic function is intern which takes a string and makes a symbol
with that print-name.  (NB! Lisp stores symbol names interally in
upper case.)

Therefore you could use something like this:

(let ((Color-symbol-number 0))
	;; Defun inside let form gives persistant variable associated
	;; with function

(defun make-new-color (r b g)
   "Makes a new color with a unique name and returns the name"
   (let ((new-name (intern
                     (format nil "COLOR-%d" (incf color-symbol-number)))))
     (make-color new-name r b g")
     new-name))

)


Actually, I'm forgetting an easier way to do this with the gensym
function.


(defun make-new-color (r b g)
   "Makes a new color with a unique name and returns the name"
   (let ((new-name (gensym "COLOR-")))
     (make-color new-name r b g")
      new-name))


(There is a subtle difference having to do with packages between
gensym and intern in ANSI Common Lisp, but I don't think Xlisp makes
that distinction.)

I hope this helps.

In what way ( in using what version ) does this not work ?
It appears to work fine for me. ( v 3.50 ):

( make-color 'mygreen 0.0 1.0 0.0 )
  [ plot something using :color 'mygreen ] 
( free-color 'mygreen )
( make-color 'mygreen 0.2 1.0 0.5 )
  [ plot something else using 'mygreen  ] 

- and if I leave the first plot showing, it evens changes color when I 
change the color bindings of 'mygreen. 


What I know doesn't work on the Mac is  #'parse-color .
I have some additional color functions for the mac that translate an
ascii RGB.txt file from and X11 distribution and lets you use all of
those colortable names. It also modifies make-color to add new colors
to the table, so parse color will work on colors not in the original
table and added dynamically. ( I needed this so I could add functions
to return a lighter or darker shade of a named color, and I should use
them in some of my plot code to make sure that colors chose for lines
are not close to the background colors. )

Hi all,
I retrived the 'clusfind' fortran programs by Rousseeuw from Statlib.
It would be interesting having such a programs running under Xlisp. 
Jan Deleeuw wrote some functions for agglomerative nesting, 
but it's cumbersome to write again in Xlisp the all set of programs.
Do you know where is, if any, an automatic translator from fortran to lisp?
Thank you,
Stefano.

Hi folks,

	I just started using 3.50 (rather than 3.47) from within emacs, and
I'm having trouble because control-d is now interpreted as "exit from
xlispstat" (and I can't seem to remap control-d to something innocuous).
Anyone have a fix?

I think you'd probably be better off compiling the fortran code &
calling it from xlispstat.  You can compile it to a .o or a shared
library, dynamically link it in, and just write wrappers for the few
fcns you want to use to convert the data from the native lisp formats
to the formats needed by the fortran code.

In what way ( in using what version ) does this not work ?
It appears to work fine for me. ( v 3.50 ):

( make-color 'mygreen 0.0 1.0 0.0 )
  [ plot something using :color 'mygreen ] 
( free-color 'mygreen )
( make-color 'mygreen 0.2 1.0 0.5 )
  [ plot something else using 'mygreen  ] 

- and if I leave the first plot showing, it evens changes color when I 
change the color bindings of 'mygreen. 


What I know doesn't work on the Mac is  #'parse-color .
I have some additional color functions for the mac that translate an
ascii RGB.txt file from and X11 distribution and lets you use all of
those colortable names. It also modifies make-color to add new colors
to the table, so parse color will work on colors not in the original
table and added dynamically. ( I needed this so I could add functions
to return a lighter or darker shade of a named color, and I should use
them in some of my plot code to make sure that colors chose for lines
are not close to the background colors. )

Hi all,
I retrived the 'clusfind' fortran programs by Rousseeuw from Statlib.
It would be interesting having such a programs running under Xlisp. 
Jan Deleeuw wrote some functions for agglomerative nesting, 
but it's cumbersome to write again in Xlisp the all set of programs.
Do you know where is, if any, an automatic translator from fortran to lisp?
Thank you,
Stefano.

Hi folks,

	I just started using 3.50 (rather than 3.47) from within emacs, and
I'm having trouble because control-d is now interpreted as "exit from
xlispstat" (and I can't seem to remap control-d to something innocuous).
Anyone have a fix?

I think you'd probably be better off compiling the fortran code &
calling it from xlispstat.  You can compile it to a .o or a shared
library, dynamically link it in, and just write wrappers for the few
fcns you want to use to convert the data from the native lisp formats
to the formats needed by the fortran code.

In the case above, 'my-color is STILL the :draw-color for the window.
I suspect it can't be totally freed. ( It's hard to test what's going on
because these lines aren't permanent, aren't redrawn and they tend to 
disappear if you try to do anything that causes a redraw. ) 
Try inserting an assignment of :draw-color to another color before 
trying to free-it. This change below works.


;;; case 1B

(setf w (send graph-window-proto :new))
(send w :use-color t)

(make-color 'my-color 1 1 0)
(send w :draw-color 'my-color)
(send w :draw-line 50 50 100 100)

( send w :draw-color 'black )    ;;;  ADD THIS LINE 

(free-color 'my-color)
(make-color 'my-color 1 0 1)
(send w :draw-color 'my-color)
(send w :draw-line 100 50 50 100)



>;;; case 2

I'm not exactly sure what you are trying to do -- if you use :draw-line,
the lines aren't permanent, so it's hard to see what the effect is.

Try this line by line and watch the effect. 
This works as I would expect: The lines are in two different colors
until the :redraw, and then they are both in the new color. 

( make-color 'this-color 1 1 0 )
( setf p ( plot-lines ( iseq 10 ) (iseq 10) :color 'this-color ))

( free-color 'this-color )

( make-color 'this-color 1 0 1 )

( send p :add-lines ( iseq 10 ) ( - 9 ( iseq 10 )) :color 'this-color )

( send p :redraw )

Not xlispstat, but I've done it in SAS. See:
http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/sugi/saslogo.html

Should be relatively easy to transscribe to lisp.

Sorry to bother the list with this, but now I have tried to long
without success: I want to put XLisp-stat on my old se30 in addition
to the pc, I downloaded the files from the net, but how can I get them from the pc
to mac? I copied them easily to the mac, as macos recognizes pc diskettes, 
but my stuffit (unstuffit) wont recognize them. Does the files get corrupted in
the transfer, or is there something else which is wrong?

Thanks, 

Kjetil.

Forrest Young replies:
Because I didn't know about it? ;-(

I see that it is documented in Luke's book, but it looks like a Unix-only
feature. I tried it with Mac XLS 4.26 and it's not found. Does it work
under MS-Windows? Or with more recent versions of XLS? If not, could it be
made to work more generally in the future? (After all, postscript is useful
under non-unix environments).  Another thought: Is the work that Jan
deLeeuw/Frederic Udina did on printing relevant here?

I'll add a PRINT menu item to the FILE menu in the next release for
whatever operating systems this works under.

The De Leeuw/Udina stuff, which can certainly be improved, gets the
contents of the slots of a graph-proto and writes a file with
instructions for gnuplot. Running gnuplot then approximates the
original plot (and there is a whole range of output devices such
as gif, fig, latex, postscript etc). Bernard Walter has written
similar code that outputs fig, which can be edited in xfig, but
is less portable than gnuplot. Ideally, someone should write yet
another module of this sort which outputs postscript (and not
just a bitmap encapsulated in postscript headers and footers).
This should also come in handy in display postscript systems
such as Rhapsody. Of course that module should be part of the
standard distribution, not just an add-on in Lisp.

Abstract
--------

This course will provide an overview of the ideas of regression graphics,
which is a collection of methodological tools that are used to discover and
understand dependence of a response on predictors primarily through the
use of simple graphs in one, two and three dimensions. It will mostly follow
the outline of the book "An Introduction to Regression Graphics", published
by Wiley in 1994. 


Prerequisite for this course is familiarity with standard
regression methodology at the level of one of the major textbooks in this
area. The course will also introduce the R-code, which is Xlisp-Stat computer
code that accompanies the book and allows the user to use all the methods
described in the book and in the course. The program is very easy to use,
and requires no knowledge of lisp.


Objectives
----------

The objectives of this course is to help university-level instructors gain  
the
confidence to use regression graphics in their own teaching, and to provide
training in the methodology for practicing statisticians for use in their own
work. Particpants will also be given access to the R-code2, the lastest  
version of the R-code.


Outline of the course
---------------------

  1. Introduction illustrating graphical issues.
  2. Foundations:  Structural dimension, sufficient summary plots, linear
  3. Finding summary plots and exploring the importance of linear predic-
     tors.
  4. Illustrations, 3D plots, residual plots
  5. Graphics for regressions with a binary response
  6. Graphics for model assessment.

Throughout the course, we will include hints for teaching, and demonstrate
the use of the R-code for doing the analyses suggested.

Target population
-----------------

The target population is graduate students, university-level instructors who
teach regression analysis, and practicing statisticians who wish to learn the
latest ideas in using graphs to understand regression problems.

Learning outcomes
-----------------

Regression analysis is one of the fundamental tools of the practicing
statistician. The traditional role of graphics in regression, at
least with many pre- dictors, has really been peripheral, dealing
mostly with questions of model adequacy. Regression graphics moves
graphs to the center of analysis. This requires some new theory,
but this theory can be presented at a very general and intuitive
level.  Our hope is to encourage the participants to use this
approach in their own work, and particularly in their own teaching.

About the Instructors
---------------------

Both instructors are professors of applied statistics at the University of
Minnesota. Much of their research over the last two decades, and much of
their teaching, has been in the areas of regression and graphics. They have
jointly written over 25 works, including the textbook An Introduction to
Regression Graphics that is the basis of this course and the 1982 monograph
"Residuals and Influence in Regression". They are both fellows of the 

American Statistical Association.

It's not too much more difficult to write those sorts of filters in
Lisp -- the advantage being that you don't need an extra step external
to the program to read in your data. 

I don't recall what Vista expects a table to look like.
There were a lot of other miscellaneous table code in the xlispstat 
archive.    I have some functions in 
 <http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Sources/tables.lsp> and
					../Sources/genutil.lsp> 
 that built tables and read in some non-lisp data files. ( Somewhere
 else in that directory is some code to read in EMMFF ascii files 
 that have a sequence of "#KEYWORD    : value" header lines that 
 give some parameters for the following spectral data. ) 


When I have the time, I'll try to write up a brief guide on how to
do this sort of thing so you can write you own custom data importers,
but one brief tip is that you can modify the lisp *readtable* temporarily,
and can change the interpretation of chars. 
 You can change "," and ";" for example to be classified as "whitespace"
 so the normal lisp reader can read in non-lisp lists of numbers. 
( I also change "#" to be a comment indicator, like ";" -- lots of unix
  produced data files use "#" as a comment indicator ( gnuplot for one 
  example ) and for the EMMFF files above, I read in the numeric data 
  and the identifying header with two different routines, so that 
  using those header lines to carry information is optional. ) 


This technique might work on Vista's reader. Just patch the readtable to 
interpret ";" as whitespace instead of a comma -- I'm not sure if you'll
get an error on the trailing ":" , but you can patch that char also.

The only 'trick' is that these patches have to be temporary -- only for
reading data files, not for reading lisp sources or command lines -- or
else you'll get all sorts of errors from lisp. You have to wrap the 
changes so that if there is an input error or other abnormal termination,
the proper default settings get restored.

         By doing just a little every day, you can gradually 
                let the task completely overwhelm you.

Hi Lispers:

I'm taking the liberty of forwarding this reply from Luke to my message to
him about priting graphics. Does anyone out there have the time and
expertise to do what Luke suggests? (I don't have the expertise). Perhaps
this would require two separate people, one for Windows and one for Mac.

Forest, et al:

	I've written a postscript routine, but the hitch is that I use all my
own methods for the plots (and maybe lots of other personal stuff). That
project is documented in 

	http://sparc20.medctr.luc.edu/~ael/classes/classes.html

I have a gzipped tarfile that you can download, and which you can try out
relatively simply (I've never used this stuff in Windows, but I use it on my
mac and unix).

	You might be able to get by with my routine without everything else
I've done - all you need to do is add a slot to your plot called plot-item,
which is a list of lists of things in the plot. That includes stings, pairs of
lists, etc. I'll include the code below, to give you the flavor.

	Good luck; write to me directly if you have any questions/comments.

							Andy

Hello Lispers,

Here is something which is by no means a complete solution to the
problem, but which may be of some help to Windows users:

There is a freeware utility Clipmeta.exe available in the the dviwin
distribution (available from CTAN in /dviware/dviwin/dviwin29.zip; CTAN
sites include ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/ and a mirror at
http://www.cdrom.com/pub/tex/ctan/).  This utility allows the contents
of the windows clipboard to be saved as a windows metafont (.wmf) file
which can later be pasted into another application such a
word-processor.  So one copies the graph via edit-copy, then calls
clipmeta which asks for a filename.

This is, for me, often more convenient than having to paste the
clipboard directly to another application "on-the-fly".  Also, the
dviwin previewer provides a "special" for the inclusion of .wmf files
into tex documents.

Clearly, this is far from a complete solution:
1)  It is obviously not portable to non-windows systems.
2)  I would rather have postscript than *.wmf .
3)  The graphs are still bitmaps instead of vector graphics with
editable contents.

I would personally like to see something like Jan DeLeeuw's system
(which apparently does give genuine vector-graphic plots, though I
haven't tried it yet), but which lets one get a postscript file directly
without having to go through gnuplot.  In the meantime, I'll use
clipmeta when I'm in a hurry and try to find time to try out Jan's
approach.

Not a lisp-stat item, but thought folks here might be interested.

I have a new Javascript-enabled SAS-powered weblet available.  It does
my Mosaic Displays of data in an n-way contingency table, using data 

entered in a form, uploaded from a file, or sample data on my server.

It generates dynamic client-side image maps, so you can click on the
graphs and see cell values displayed (if your browser supports
JavaScript.) 


It's located at:

Comments welcome.

Hello,

I'm a beginner in XLispStat.  I must make cross-tables from two columns
of a file.  For instance, the first colums is the sex (the value F or M)
and the second the age.  I want a table computing the number of sex F
and M for all ages :

age | M | F
------------
20  | 3 | 5
25  | 6 | 3

How can I make this ?

Thanks in advance.

Isabelle

Sorry to hit the whole list with this but I've lost the instructions for
getting on and off this list.  Seems the rm command in a mail directory
wipes the slate clean ...  ;-)

Oh yeah, what are the instructions?

Subject: XLS and ilisp
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu

Dear all,

Yesterday I tried to install ilisp-5.8 for use with xlispstat, but
couldn't get very far. I was able to start XLS in an emacs buffer, but
it was not possible to send a defun from some file to the lisp process
(eval-defun-lisp). With the settings as they were, I got the error
"ilisp-eval-command not defined" (or similar). I then copied the
corresponding definition from the ilisp-cl.el into ilisp-xls.el, and
recompiled. Now I got another "... undefined" error.

I then realized that the xlisp dialect as defined in ilisp-xls.el
inherits from the ilisp dialect, which is difficult to understand for
me because ilisp doesn't appear as dialect in the docs. Ok, scheme
also inherits from ilisp. Hm.

When changing the parent mode to clisp, there were no more
error-messages, but after 5 min or so at 80% of an Ultra processor, I
thought that there would be no further results either, and stopped. 

My brief question (after that lengthy intro, sorry): before I dig
deeper into it, is there anybody who could provide me with a more
complete version of
(defdialect xlisp "Xlisp" ilisp
  (setq ilisp-load-command "(load \"%s\")"
        ilisp-last-command "*")
  )
than this version from ilisp-xls.el? 

Thank you very much!

Johannes

The ilisp stuff is for ilisp 5.6 -- ilisp is quite an unstable system,
with maintainers and basic interfaces changing a lot, so probably
5.8 is quite different from 5.6. Basically what I did is copy the
scheme interface and do some minor tweaks -- I am sure the same
route is still open for 5.8. Actually, it's on my list of things to
do, which is however (5/8/97) 3.5 miles long. By the way, I think it
is on Luke's list too.

This is a bit off the subject, but since the issue concerns
programs I have written in XLS I thought someone might have
some input.
  Good Laboratory Practices, the bane of industrial labs, 
requires that software be "verified".  Does anyone have 
any experience with verifying software or suggestions of
a procedure that would sufficiently appease regulators.

Any thoughts would be appreciated!

ilisp is a bunch of emacs lisp files that make it easy to edit and
run various lisps from emacs -- you edit your lisp in one window
and submit it directly to the interpreter that is running in
another window. It can be configured for different lisp systems.
If you set it up properly you approximate the ease of use of the
mac version, but you have a lot of additional power because all
the other emacs functions are available as well.

a reasonably nice inferior-lisp mode in Emacs/XEmacs.

(an improvement on running xlispstat, scheme, or common lisp (many
variants) from within Emacs, from M-x shell or M-x terminal).

What is the matter with inferior-lisp-mode (which is built into
lisp).  I thought that this was a standard package in emacs and it
might work better than ilisp, or at least be easier to set up.  I
thought was just a matter of setting one variable in emacs.

Nothing is wrong with it -- but ilisp has many more features (similar
to comparing standard TeX mode with AUC-TeX -- there are good reasons
for both... except that ilisp used to not be as stable; I've not used
it recently so can't compare...).

Actually, the recent (beta/alpha) version of S-mode will handle
XLispStat, though not to the same functionality as Splus or R. 

If interested, retrieve:
	http://www.stat.sc.edu/~rossini/projects/S-mode-4.9-b5.tar.gz
or
	ftp://ftp.math.sc.edu/rossini/S-mode-4.9-b5.tar.gz

The command for XLispStat is M-x XLS, in this scenario.

The current plan is to have all S dialects as well as XLispStat and a
nice mechanism for ViSta supported from within Emacs or XEmacs.

S-mode 5.0 is currently code-named istat-5.0 (implying interactive,
interpretative statistics in Emacs).

best,

I recently had a need for plotting the calculated standard errors 
around a line plot of my data, so instead of using error-bars,
I used a colored region around the line, + or - the error. 
This was quite easy using my color graph overlay code:

( defmeth scatterplot-proto :add-error-band 
  ( x y yerror &key fill-color )
  ( let (( xband ( combine x ( reverse x )))
         ( yband ( combine ( + y yerror ) 
         		 (reverse ( - y yerror )))))
   ( send self :add-overlay 
           ( poly  ( transpose ( list xband yband )) 
           			:fill-color fill-color ))))


It creates a polygon region by folding y+error and y-error. 
( i.e. one of them is reversed so it folds back and closes )


[ This will eventually get documented and added to the overlay
  methods at http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Sources/ ]

Does anyone out there know how to save plots in color postscript
form?  The save-to-file in the plots menu saves black and white only.

I need that too. If it's not available, I would suggest establishing some
standard about how to store colored polygons in a XLS graph-proto object.
That way, is someone can find a way to translate plot to postscript
including filled polygons, it will work for weverybody. The same call for
standars is for storing text.

For example, it could be,

slot 'text
Every entry is a list '(text x y h v &optional font size color)
slot must contain a list s such entries.
x y h v follow the help of :draw-text method

slot 'polygons
contain a list of polygons, each one being a list
(coordinates color ... ???)
where coordinates is ...

any suggestion?

I am putting the xlispstat archive partly in an mSQL database, to
conform to the bookmarks database on our main server, and the
bookmarks databases in the IMS homepage and the Journal of Statistical
Software homepage. In fact, these are all (cleverly) disguised
subtrees of a single large bookmarks database. See
 
http://www.stat.ucla.edu/bookmarks/bookmarks.phtml?book=xls&parent=/
 
and then go to artificial intelligence or mathematics/libraries which
are already partially filled. The leaves of the tree are still
unix directories, which get an interface provided by Apache, but the
branches of the tree are mSQL records.
 
It will take me a while to move the stuff, in the meantime the basic
interface from the UCLA Statistics homepage will remain the same.

Subject: Getting graphics in an X window (Linux)
X-Mailer: Pegasus Mail for Win32 (v2.53/R1)
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk

I've just set up a Debian GNU/Linux system on my computer and one of 
the first things I wanted to get running was xlispstat. Release 3-50 
wouldn't compile (I'll post another message about that later) so I'm 
using 3-47 instead.

I want to have access to interactive graphics in pop-up windows 
like I've seen in the MS-Windows version of xlispstat. If I look at 
my environment variables, I have DISPLAY defined as
	:0.0
which I believe is correct given that I'm not on a network, just 
running the X server on the same machine that is running xlispstat.

Yet when I try something like
	(plot-lines (list 1 2 3) (list 1 2 3))
I get some escape codes or whatnot from the GNUPLOT Tektronix 
routines. For some reason, xlispstat doesn't seem to notice that I'm 
running under X windows.

My setup is a PC running Debian GNU/Linux 1.2.8 and the XFree86 3.2 
software. My window manager is one called "wm2" and I'm just opening 
a generic xterm and typing xlispstat at the shell prompt. Is there 
perhaps a command-line switch that I should invoke? Or maybe I need 
to define DISPLAY as something else.

Any help is appreciated.

Hello,

I'm a beginner in xlispstat.
I would like to write the result of calculations in a file.  Per
instance : >(def toto (+1 2)) ; I would like to write "toto 3" in a
file.  How can I do this ?

Thanks in advance

Args: (destination control &rest args)
Very basic implementation of Common Lisp format function. Only A, S, D,
F, E, G, %, and ~ directives are supported. D, % and ~ can take one
argument, R, E and G can take two.

What is A, S, D, etc... ?

Thank you in advance.

Hi!
    I am new to xlisp-stat. I have a simple question that how can I keep
the 'text' on the graph which generated by 'draw-text' or 'draw-string'?
Right now once I click the graph or other window, the printed text is
dispeared.

Thanks!

Ren

Two possible references for the CL format function are

	Common Lisp, the Language, 2nd edition,
	Chapter 22:Output Functions:Formatted Output to Character Streams
	http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html

and

	Common Lisp HyperSpec
	http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html

Keep in mind that only a subset of format directives is supported.

:draw-text, :draw-string, and any of the :draw- methods are immediate
mode drawing. They do not add points, lines or text to the graph in
the way that :add-lines, :add-points do. You need you :draw-text 
method to be called by the graph's :redraw method if you want it to 
be a persistant graphics object. ( Besides the redraw on uncovering
the graph, you will see if you try to copy and paste the graphics 
window into another program, none of the non redrawn graphics gets
copied -- copy does and implicit :redraw. ) 

[1] You can put the :draw-text into the graph's :redraw method. 

[2] You can use a more general solution, as in:
 <http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Sources/realgraf.lsp> 
 ( and some other supporting files in that directory -- see 
 <http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Docs/SourceIndex.html> ) 
 which creates graph overlays for rectangles, lines, points, labels, 
 etc. as well as composit graph objects ( a grouping of any of the
 primitives ) which are automatically called on the graph's :redraw. 

[3] If you want to do something similar, but different, the comments
 in the source code explain some of what's going on. Some of it is
 explained in the XlispStat book. Some of it has been changed slightly
 in 3.50. The is lots of discussion of this in the mailing list archive.

Try the following .lsp file.  There are instructions at the top of the file.
http://www.stat.ucla.edu/develop/lisp/xlisp/xlisp-stat/code/statistics
/plotting/strays/labels.lsp 

It provides a graphical interface to putting point labels on plots (and
keeping them there..through modifying the graph-protos redraw method...
option #1 on Dr. Majewski's suggestion list).  Labels can be placed,
aligned, erased, or moved.

Forgive me if this question is as dumb as I first thought, but I've had a lot
more trouble than I expected.

I'm trying to maximise a function lik using (newtonmax #'lik ... ) in the
usual way; however, this is a function whose values are usually in the region
10^-320.  Newtonmax invariably finds the gradient is less than gradient
tolerance immediately - is this because the tolerance is a constant, and so a
function with such small return values will always have a gradient less than
the tolerance?  Or does it measure the tolerance relative to the function
value?

I did indeed try the obvious, ie (defun newlik (x) (* 1e320 (lik x))) in order
to maximise newlik instead.  However, (newlik x) invariably evaluates to
#.POSITIVE-INFINITY even for x values such that (lik x) is about 1e-318.  I
can't find a way to prevent the overflow.

Thanks in advance for any help, 

Richard Stevens

Hi

Has anybody noticed that when installing a cross coursor in a white
over black window in Xlisp-Stat running over Windoze 3.1 the cursor is 
not visible?
Is it an known bug or is my own problem? I have no problems running the 
code on Mac, Win95 or Unix, but a user reports that problem using
Win3.1 with  XLS-3.50.

I insist, the window has black background, with white background there is 
no problem at all.

Thanks to Russell and Jan for suggesting I work with (log lik).  At first this
gave underflow, but now I have a routine that directly calculates log-lik (as
opposed to (defun log-lik (x) (log (lik x)))) it seems to work.

Cheers,

The cross is one of MS's standard system cursors, so any problems with
it are Redmond's -- it looks like they arranged for it to use xor
drawing on Win95.

I have updated the directory of Xlisp-Stat demos on

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/textbook/demos/

It now has foo.xli for the files that need to be downloaded and run
and foo.lsp for the files that need to be downloaded and displayed
in the browser (as text files).

Our server is set up appropriately, you have to configure your client
accordingly.

Hi! everyone,
  
    I need to link 2 graphs together and when select part of first plot
(plot-points), I want to paste the result based on selection as text on the 
second graph (for example, I want to show the correlation between selected x,y,
detail listed below). Is there a way to do this? Thank you very much!

(def plot1 (plot-points x y :title "scatterplot 1"
              :variable-labels (list "x" "y")))
(setf w (send graph-proto :new 2))
(defun corr (x y)
    (/ (sum (* (- x (mean x)) (- y (mean y))))
      (* (- (length x) 1) (standard-deviation x) (standard-deviation y))))
(def tmp (send plot1 :selection))
(def result (corr (select x tmp) (select y tmp)))

I want to show result (for example, 0.512) on 'w' as text.


Ren

Hello,

I would like to read a file with 30 columns.
This my command :

(def mydata 
      (read-data-columns "/usr/users/testbeta/data/yreisen.sas"))

and when I press "return",  there is an error message :

Error: invalid dotted pair
Happened in: #<Subr: #80e5050>

What is it ?   Is there an invalid charater in my file ?
I have already delete the ":".

Thanks in advance for your answers and Have a nice day.

Hello,

I have another question.

My variable content any 0, 1 and "." and I would like to count the
number of 0, 1 and "."
This is my script :

(def var (list 1 0 0 1 "." 1))
(def nbr0 (length (which (=  var 0))))

and the error message :

Error: not a number - "."
Happened in: #<Subr: #8299c90>

How can I count ?  What must I put in place of the = ?

Thanks in advance.

Hello everybody,

I would like to define the name of a variable with the value of an other
variable :


(def var (list 1 2 3))
(dolist ( i var ) ( def newvar-i toto))

where newvar-i = newvar-1 the first time, newvar-2 the second time, ...

I don't know how say to my script it's the value of i and no the
character i.  How make this ?

Thanks in advance.

Try this:

(def var (list 1 2 3))
(def values (list 6 8 10))
(dolist ( i var )
 ( set (intern (string-upcase (format nil  "newvar-~d" i))) (select
values (- i 1))))

The expression
    (string-upcase (format nil  "newvar-~d" i))
is used here to emphasize upper case, in the present instance the
expression
  (format nil "NEWVAR-~d" i)
should work just as well.

Note the this will not cause the variables newvar-1,...,newvar-3 to
appear on the lsip-stat *variables* list (accessible by typing
*variables* or (variables) ).  If you want that to occur, you can try
the following code.  (I am not completely comfortable with this  direct
access of *variables*  , but I don't know a more elegant method to
accomplish the objective -- the macro "def" won't work here because it
doesn't evaluate its first argurment.)

(def var (list 1 2 3))
(def values (list 6 8 10))
(dolist ( i var )
 ( set (intern (string-upcase (format nil  "newvar-~d" i))) (select
values (- i 1)))
 ( pushnew (find-symbol (string-upcase (format nil  "newvar-~d" i)))
*variables*))

I am trying to write a log-likelihood function for a simple
ordered regression problem, and sincerely cannot understand
why the following doesn't work:

 (defun log-lik-lat (n)
   (let ((n1 (first n))
         (n2 (rest  n)))
     (flet ((ft (theta m &rest u)
                (let* ((res (mapcar #'normal-cdf u))
                       (res1 (combine 0.0 res 1.0))
                       (dif (difference res1)))
                  (sum   (break) (* m (log dif) ))  )))
       #'(lambda (theta &rest u)
           (+ (ft 0.0    n1 u) 
              (ft theta  n2 u))))))



(def n (list(list 73 45 28 29 25) (list 25 27 34 42 72)) )       

(def p (log-lik-lat n))

 (funcall p 1 -1.0 -0.5 0.5 1)     

I get the following error:

Error: bad argument type - NIL
Happened in: #<Subr: #7c0d98>

Also: How can I identify the subroutine causing the problem from
the above cryptic error?

(I am using xlsp 3.50 on windows 95)

Thank you, Kjetil Halvorsen.

Another revision of my survival analysis package is available from
http://www.biostat.washington.edu/~thomas/cox.html

Apart from various minor fixes the main new thing is the ability to
calculate and plot the survival functions for arbitrary covariate
patterns. There is a dynamic graphics demonstration of the effect of
covariates on the fitted survival curve for a Cox model, with sliders to
vary each of the covariates. The demonstration is also set up as a 
single file for use over the net. 

The data set I have provided for this is not great, as two of the
covariates are discrete, but you can run it on any data of your choice.


- Thomas Lumley

Summary of package tcoxreg.lsp
------------------------------
This fits the stratified Cox regression model to data with right censoring
and optional left truncation.  Both the Efron and Breslow (Peto)
adjustments for ties are available. In addition to time-dependence in
step-function form which can be done with truncation/censoring there is a
facility for arbitrary continuous time-dependence (which is very slow).
Plots of the baseline survival and hazard functions and of the scaled
Schoenfeld residuals are available, as are tests of the proportional
hazards assumption based on (scaled) Schoenfeld residuals (Grambsch and
Therneau, Biometrika, 1994)

Hi there,

I'm using (or trying to!) xls 3.50 on a Win95 machine. When I start a 
fresh xlisp-stat and issue
(save-workspace "filename")
I got a filename.wks file as expected.

If then I drag the icon onto the lisp-stat icon, it doesn't start 
properly. If I rename the filename.wks to xlisp.wks, it works.

Is there any other way to start xlisp-stat using this new workspace?

Hi,

   Does anyone use xlisp-s to get S and xlispstat interface recently ? I 
downloaed the 'xlisp-s' file from STATLIB. When I followed the instruction 
of the files I down-loaded I got some error message at xlisp-stat prmopt: 
for example, 1. file does not exist - "userhome.fsl", 
             2. file does not exist - "/home/odin/ryu/tmp/S.to.CL"
where "/home/odin/ryu' is my home directory.
Does this mean I didn't get all files? How can I get those files ?

   Thank you for your help!

Subject: compiling for Solaris with gcc
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk

Hello,

I have searched the archive (the one I could find!) but can't find
pointers on compiling for Solaris 2.5.1 with gcc.

I am getting errors on memmove redefined (among others) and I can see
that the configure program prints a line that says something like
'looking for memmove ...	(cached) no'.

If anyone can point me to a resource or tell me what I should do to
compile I would appreciated the help.  If there is an archive or
FAQ page please send that info too.

I have Solaris 2.5.1 for X86.  When I ran the configure program I
used the option 'with-gcc' and also set the X11 libs to point to
/usr/openwin.

Thank you,
Juniata Lees

I have a largish data set (179 units) on which I need to do some
hierarchical cluster analysis.  I found the agnes (agglomerative nesting)
function written by Jan de Leeuw and a mst (minimum spanning) function
written by David Betz.  Unfortunately neither of these are documented and I
can't work out just what they do.  The agnes function returns a very long
list of numbers - but what are they?  Is there any graphical display
available?  I haven't tried the mst function yet but it doesn't look like
it does any plotting.  Has anyone written code to produce graphics from
this function?  Anyone got a dendrogram function?  What I really want to be
able to do is to link the mst or dendrogram to various namelists containing
information about the units and to an x,y plot of their location to see if
the clusters have common properties and any spatio-temporal continuity.
Any help would be much appreciated.
Many thanks,

Agnes does agnes -- agglomerative nesting.

(defun agnes (diss &key (type "average") (ultrametric nil))

It prints two lists: the list of successive clusterings, and the list
of cluster values. Input is a dissimilarity matrix, type can be
ward, gower, weighted, single, average, and complete.

There is no graphics.

minimum-spanning-tree computes the minimum spanning tree, i.e.
it gives a list of the edges of the tree given a dissimilarity
matrix.

I have also tried to find out about agnes, my incomplete understanding
up to now is: Agnes takes as input a distance matrix, so in the case
of 179 units it will be 179*179 symmetric. Agnes does not compute
the distance matrix from a variables*cases matrix, so this the user
has to supply. The output virtually is the dendrogram in list form, 
so with 5 cases one might get something like:

( ((1) (2) (3) (4) (5))( (1 2) (3) (4) (5))( (1 2) (3) (4 5))
   ( ( 1 2 3) (4 5) ) ( (1 2 3 4 5) ) )
(with some extra spaces added, and hopefully parenthesis correctly
counted!) This would correspond to a dendrogram as:
1-\
   >-\                                        The output is a level 3
list, first level a list of
2-/   \                                       succesive agglomerative
solutions, each of this solutions
       >-----\                                is a list of groupings, at
start al solutions are singletons,
      /       \                               and at each new step in
the agglomerative process, two
3----/         \                              groups are united.
                >--------
               /
4-\           /
   >---------/
5-/

I would also be interested in code for producing graphics from this
function.

Hope this helps, 

Kjetil Halvorsen.

At http://www.stat.ucla.edu/calculators/xlispstat
there is a new Xlisp-Stat calculator that allows anybody

It is not possible to do graphics at the moment, and
the system and popen functions are disabled, for

I developed and continue to use a suite of lispstat functions which I
call Autopaint, that allow me to examine multiple low-dimensional
plots of a high dimensional data set and link patterns across graphs
using color.

Much of my work involves cluster analysis.  Using Autopaint, I can put
up a dendrogram, paint portions of the dendrogram and Autopaint maps
those colors to the corresponding data objects' data point
representations in other graphs such as a scatterplot matrix, grand
tour, 3d spin etc.  

I use Autopaint/LispStat in conjunction with Splus, doing much of my
number crunching in Splus (so for example I use the Splus hclust routine
for clustering).  I adapted a set of common-lisp to S routines written
by Wayne Olford at U of Waterloo, that allows the lisp-stat user to
invoke a background Splus session, pass off data to that process, then
get results back.  Sometimes it's a bit clunky, but it beats rewriting
all statistical software into yet another computer language. 

I incorporated the object-oriented data representation discussed in
Tierney's "LispStat" book, Chapter 10 Section 6 'An Alternative
Linking Strategy", which works very well and allows the user to select
subsets and color them and have the selections and colors correctly
updated in all plots displaying any amount of the total data set. 

All of this still operates under old faithful and reliable LispStat
version 2.1 release 2. 

I do not yet have a manual for the suite of programs, but I would be
happy to share the code which others could adapt or just use as
examples when writing their own code.

Let me know if you'd like a copy.

Hi Lisp-Staters:

With the Mac version of Lisp-Stat you can send text to a text window. This
can be done by:
(setf w (send display-window-proto :new ))
(send w :paste-string string)

However, if STRING has more text than will show in the window, then what
you see is the LAST portion of the text rather than the FIRST. Does anyone
know how to change this so the first portion is viewed?

Hajimemashite



I study how preshool children play in free play. I want to use 

Lag sequential method to analyze it. 



I had written the following program in xlisp-stat (Win-16; 

version 2.1R3 Alpha 6). But I give the following message 

from interpreter: 



error: index out of range - 11 (when lag is 2)



I think that this program can check if index is out of range

in Line 12.



Variable 'len' in function 'conditional-probability' is set in

Line 6:



If 'data' contains 10 element and 'lag' is 2,

'len' will be 7. Then when 'cnt' is 8, line 12

'(if (< cnt len)' will be nil and interpreter

will not evaluate line 13, 14.



But interpreter does that. I have no idea.



This program is my first program in xLisp-stat.

I lose my way. Please help me.

We developed menu-oriented XLISP-STAT programs for drawing dendrogram
cluster analysis. You can download the programs by connecting the
following addres:

Hope you enjoy the program.

We developed menu-oriented XLISP-STAT programs for drawing dendrogram
cluster analysis. You can download the programs by connecting the
following addres:

http://myhuh.skku.ac.kr/software/software.html

The program may run very slow with large number of observations. This is
intrinsic problem for XLISP-STAT.

Hope you enjoy the program.

Hello world.  I'd like to plot a graph - using plot-function or perhaps
plot-lines - with labelled axes.  I'm looking at page 123 of the book by Luke
Tierney (Section 4.1, "Input/Output", at the end of subsection 4.1.3) and it
tells me

"the :labels keyword argument to plot-function takes a list of strings to use
as the axis labels"

However, I'm executing

(plot-function #'p6 0 1 :labels (list 'x 'y) )

and I get a plot with no axis-labels.  What am I doing wrong?  Please help -
I'd like to include these graphs in my thesis!

AdThanksvance,

Subject: Histogram bin width calculation question
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk

Hi,
	I've been playing around with histograms in XLISPSTAT recently and
have come up with the following question.


Suppose I have a set x
	(def x '(1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5))

I create a histogram of x

	(def hx (histogram x))

First I call scaled-range to see what the default range of the histogram is

	(send hx :scaled-range 0)

and I get (1.0 5.0) i.e. the bins of hx range from 1.0 to 5.0 inclusive so
as to capture all the data.

Now I set the number of bins in hx to be 5

	(send hx :num-bins 5)

I can clearly see the staircase efect of the histogram

However if I set the number of bins in hx to be 4

	(send hx :num-bins 4)

I get a rather weird effect.  The bin ranges seem to be as follows

	1 <= r1 <= 2
	2 <  r2 <  3
	3 <= r3 <= 4
	4 <  r3 <= 5

Here it seems that bin widths are not fixed.  What I need to know are the
ranges of each bin.  Can anyone give me some clues as to how to calculate
this?  I was trying something like:

(def bwidth (/ (- (cadr (send hx :scaled-range 0))
                  (car (send hx :scaled-range 0)))
               (send hx :num-bins)))

(def minhx (car (send hx :scaled-range 0)))

(def ranges '())

(dotimes(i (send hx :num-bins) ranges)
  (setf ranges
    (append ranges
      (list
        (list (+ minhx (* i bwidth))
            (+ minhx (* (+ i 1) bwidth)))))))

which yields

 ((1.0 2.0) (2.0 3.0) (3.0 4.0) (4.0 5.0))

in other words

  1.0 <= r1 < 2.0
  2.0 <= r2 < 3.0
  3.0 <= r3 < 4.0
  4.0 <= r4 < 5.0

This is certainly flawed in that the upper limit of the last bin must be <=
5.0, it also assumes all bins are the same width, which is clearly not the
case.

Can anyone give me an idea of how I can accurately predict the lower and
upper limits of a histogram in xlisp-stat?

 Thanks for any help,
				Dom.

Well, the xlisp-stat histogram function simply do not work well. Just try 
playing around with the window width (I mean the window that display your 
histogram) and you will see nice things.

There are several replacement histogram packages. I actually have 
one in 
ftp://ftp.upf.es/pub/stat/anchor-position/
that was specialized for the work on the paper you will find there.

Subject: Dialog box question - injecting text
Sender: owner-stat-lisp-news@umnstat.stat.umn.edu
Precedence: bulk

Hi,
	I am currently working with dialogs in XLISP-STAT on a Mac and am
wondering if there is any way of 'injecting' text into a
edit-text-item-proto object in the dialog.

	Say a user clicks a button, this would cause text to be inserted
into the current string of the edit-text-item-proto at the current
insertion point.  I have tried using the :TEXT method of the
edit-text-item-proto but that only returns the current string, so you still
have no way of knowing where the insertion point (the cursor if you like)
is within the string.

	Other ideas included using WRITE-STRING with the dialog input
stream but I cannot work out what stream it is using.

	Another idea I had was to use the clipboard and to simulate a paste
command.  Curiously paste works only with modal dialogs.  With modeless
dialogs the cut/copy/paste commands are available from the edit menu but
they do not do anything.  If I issue the :MODAL-DIALOG message to a
modeless dialog cut/copy/paste then work!  Is there a good reason why they
don't work on modeless dialogs?


		Thanks for any help or comments,

					Dom.

What is really the differences between defining with def and with setf?
After (def x '(1 2 3))
x is a variable; (variables) returns a list containing x, which doesnt
occur with setf. Probably this means there is no way to free the space
allocated with setf?, cannot be freed with undef.

> (def x (list 2 4 6))
X

(X)
> (setf y (list 1 2 3))
(1 2 3)

(X)

Is there some situations where one can be used, and not the other?

Thanks, Kjetil.

Is there a date/time function in XLS that I can use

in EXCEL is what I'm looking for.

  What is really the differences between defining with def and with setf?
  After (def x '(1 2 3))
  x is a variable; (variables) returns a list containing x, which doesnt
  occur with setf. Probably this means there is no way to free the space
  allocated with setf?, cannot be freed with undef.

Def is a macro defined by Luke which does a number of things in
addition to setf:

1) It adds the variable to the (variables) list.

2) It declares the variable to be special as with defvar.  (This has
scoping implications, see a good Lisp text, not just Luke's book.)
Essentially, it allows you to refer to the global value within
functions and methods without explicitly passing it.

3) It sets the value ala setf or setq.  (This is an immediate set, in
contrast to defvar which does not set the value of the symbol if it
already has a value.  This behavior of Lisp is somewhat surprizing the
first time you change a bad initial value set using defvar, reload the
file and don't see the value change.)

I'm not sure exactly what the undef macro does.

As far a freeing the storage for the variable goes, there is two
things you can worry about:

1) freeing the storage for the value of the variable (e.g., a large
data table or complex object).  This is simple.  In both cases,
changing the value of the variable will free the storage for the array
(as soon as no variable or other data structure points to it, it will
become garbage and cleaned up in the next garbage collection).  Thus
to free up this storage, just set it to some convenient value,
e.g. NIL.  (Warning:  getting NIL from a variable which was "destroyed"
in this way were you were expecting a number or some other real value
is a common source of Lisp bugs).

2) Freeing the storage for the symbol object itself is much more
complicated.  You need to make it unbound (not just set its value to
nil), make sure it doesn't have function or property definitions, and
then unintern it from its package before it becomes garbage.  Few Lisp
programmers bother.  I don't know if undef does this, or simply makes
the variable unbound and removes it from the list.

  At my request, Luke very kindly added a #'(get-decoded-time) function,
which returns the time as a multiple-values list  --
#'(get-internal-real-time)
returns an internal tick count.  I needed to add ascii timestamps to my
data files to make them EMSA/EMMFF legal format ( and besides, it's
a useful bit of information for your data! )  
 This was a fairly recent addition: I think it's only in 3.50 .

I've written a time-stamp object which handles formatting:

; loading :timestmp.lsp
; finished loading "timestmp.lsp"
( setf time ( send time-stamp :new ))

OBJECT

'time' above is a time-stamp object whose :print method writes out 
an ascii string similar to  what posix ctime() returns. 
( The last three definitions are for the EMSA/EMMFF, which wants
  separate "#Date:" and "#Time:" headers, rather than ctime() format. 
 FYI: EMSA/EMMFF is a standard ascii format used in microscopy
 for  EDS/WDS/EELS  spectra. )

Sorry -- the "temporary" relocation of my site to 
<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/>
while my server was down has dragged on, as I've had no time to be a
sysadmin!



<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Docs/jitterplot-examples.html>

contains the images:

<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Docs/Ca-conc.box.snap.gif>

<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Docs/jitter-test.GIF>


and a link to the XlispStat implementation: jitterpl.lsp.  
However, jitterpl.lsp requires readgraf.lsp, and several other modules, so 
if you want to try to use this code, you need to look upstream at either:

<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Docs/xesapp.html>

or mostly at the annotated soure index at:

<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Docs/SourceIndex.html>


There was a bug in the code that was posted there until recently. These
are snapshots of my working code, and the penultimate set of changes 
made composit graph objects non-working -- which I didn't notice until
I tried the jitterplots again recently. I've just uploaded the latest fixed
-- 
:redraw and :resize were required to migrate up to a super class. 


After a long spell of working on some other projects, I'm back to cleaning
up and documenting this package, so I hope to have it in better shape soon.

( Including a more integrated distribution. ) 


  I have done some nice graphs recently using the graph objects in
realgraf.lsp
to plot continuous data with error bands, instead of error bars around
descrete
points: for example, one set of data plotted as a dark blue line over a
wider,
light blue error band, the other set as a red line over a pink band. 
  I'll try to add both code and graphic examples to my pages soon.  


I'm cc-ing this to the xlisp-stat mailing list, both to notify of the bug
fix,
and to take a chance to plug Michael's enormous list of statistics resource
links:

Hi

This is SanthaKumar from Motorola India Elecronics Limited (MIEL),
Bangalore, India.

To install R-Code software I downloaded xlispstat-3-50 from the site
ftp://ftp.stat.umn.edu/pub/xlispstat/3-50/xlispstat-3-50.tar.gz

But then I could not compile the stuff as I encounter some problems
in 'make' which I could not figure out. I'm including the log so that
u can figure out on whats wrong and find if you can help me out.

I'm trying to install this in my Sun Sparc machine.

Regards,
Shantha.

[ There is actually a question here -- skip to the bottom if 
  you're not interested in the background discussion. ] 

 You get to appreciate Lisp's automatic memory management/garbage 
collection when you try to do something with the color tables in
XlispStat. Color table entries have to be added add freed manually,
and if you free a color that's used in a plot, you get an error 
when that plot attemps to :redraw itself. It would be nice if 
colors could be automatically managed, however, since they do 
refer to a finite system resource, it's probably not possible to
combine explicit control over that resource with automagic 
management. ( Sigh! ;-) 

 Anyway: I've been trying to clean up some of my graphics classes
<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Docs/SourceIndex.html> 
and I've been working on fixing some of the semi-working methods 
in colors.lsp. 
 I had functions for generating colors lighter or darker than a 
given color.  This was intended so that selected objects could
change their colors and that composite graphics objects could 
manage their own "color-families". ( for example: for the "error-band"
plots, I want the data shown with a colored line, and the +/- error-band
drawn beneath the line as a lighter colored, but same hue, solid poly
region, and it would be nice if the default colors could be selected
automagically. ) However, to avoid having the color table get filled
up with automatically generated colors, I wanted to find out if there
is a 'close-enough" existing color, either in the (color-symbols) table,
or in the RGB.txt generated list available to #'parse-color . 
( My colors.lsp code initially started out as a Mac equivalent to X11's
parse-color.)

 I had some problems with regression towards grey in my close-to 
color functions -- both with the original versions and my newer
and better code. This seems to be mostly due to using the X11 RGB.TXT
file as my test colortable -- grays are heavily represented, and the
darker hues are particularly under-represented. ( see:
<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XLS/>  I also now have some
RGB <-> HSL color converter functions -- I'm experimenting with
a stronger weight for Hue in the color comparison. ) 


<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XLS/> are gifs of spin-plots
of the RGB.TXT color file, plotted in the rgb color space, with
some of the points colored their appropriate color. 

I had assumed that there was a 256 color limit in Mac XlispStat 3.50,
however, when generating those color spin plots I realized that there
are actually 256 + 8 color entries. The first two gifs 
<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XLS/rgb-1.gif> and
<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XLS/rgb-2.gif>
are plotted with that size color table. 

When I realized the error of my assumption, I tried rebuilding
XlispStat with a 512 + 8 color table allocation. A similar color
spin plot is <http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XLS/rgb-3.gif> 

However, you will note that some of the colors are colored wrongly. 
I don't think this was a bug in my code -- it was pretty simple 
and obvious and only a few lines of code -- and it mostly looks
correct. 

Finally, the Questions:

[1] Is this effect dues to ( I'm guessing, based on remembering
some previous mailing list threads ... ) the guess that XlispStat
does not actually manage color pallettes via #'add-color, but is
going thru an existing pallette, and thus another "close enough" 
translation by the system ? 

[2] Any other known limitations of color graphics in XlispStat --
 especially cross platform issues ? I would like to keep my code
 platform portable. Are there any fixed color-table sizes in the
 X11 or MS-Win versions ? ( Or, are the color bugs  I'm seeing due
 to some Mac hardwired limitation I'm not aware of ? ) 

[3] Anybody have any other ideas of how to do this sort of color
  management better ? 


[ BTW: The new color code is not posted to the web yet, but it 
  will be updated soon. ]

Hi folks:

1) The new version of ViSta for Unix (version 4.28) is now available.

2) If you missed the announcement, ViSta for Windows (version 4.28, August
13th, 1997) has been slightly revised so that it:
   a) unzips properly under Windows 3.1 (16 and 32 bit versions)
   b) works if moved to a new directory, or if the directory is renamed.
It continues to unzip properly for Windows 95, NT and OS/2. The new version
now works with directory changes under these systems. You can modifiy the
statinit.lsp file in the previous version (4.28, August 1st, 1997) to allow
changing and renaming directories. This is done by changing the line:
#+msdos (working-directory *default-path*) to:
#+msdos (working-directory (strcat (get-working-directory) separator))

3) Also, ViSta for Mac and PowerMac (version 4.28) in either English or
French, was announced at the beginning of August.

The new Unix version and revised MSWindows versions are available from the
following servers:
http://forrest.psych.unc.edu/research/    USA Home Site
http://www.psych.unc.edu/fwy              USA Mirror Master Site

Hi!!

I'd like to use XList-Stat with a C++ program using Visual C++.
Does anyone ever use DDE to send Lisp string like "(car '(a b c))"
to XLisp-Stat and get the result string back.
eg.

char r[255];

r = XLisp("(car '(1 2 3))");
// r contains result string from xlisp

FYI: Here's how to plot the distribution of colors in the rgb color
space cube. ( free-extra-colors and *colortable* , and maybe some
other things here are defined in 
<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Sources/colors.lsp> )



This will not load, however, as the ignore-errors wrapped around
the add-color call that is expected to eventually overflow, seems
to  work properly when I cut and paste this code interactively,
however, it fails and caused a break into the lisp debugger,
when I load it from a file. 

I tried wapping it again in an unwind-protect clause, but with
the same result. 

Am I doing something wrong ? 
Is there another way to get the same effect -- i.e. how do I 
continue to load in spite of errors -- in this case, it's 
an expected error.

-- I forgot: 

I meant to add to the previous that I now notice that even with
the smaller number of rgb colors set in the source code, I get
what look like a few misplaced colors in that spin plot -- I'm 
still not sure what the cause is.

This appears to be due to a bug in the byte code interpreter which
I'll track down and fix in the next release.

 (send hist :slot-value 'histogram-internals)
(#<Data: #7cf6a4> . #<Data: #7d81e4>)

this is the data, but cannot see a way to access them, as is
possible with a regression model object.

All of the plot objects have a :POINT-COORDINATE method:


> ( send h :help :point-coordinate )
POINT-COORDINATE
Method args: (var point &optional value)
Sets or retrieves coordinate for variable VAR and point POINT in the
original coordinate system. Vectorized.

VAR is the variable, i.e. which dimension of the plot. Histograms
are unidimensional, so VAR = 1.

"Vectorized" means that point can be a single point number or a 
list of point numbers. To get all of the data points:


( send hist :point-coordinate 1 ( iseq ( send hist :num-points )))


The y value of the histogram plots is not really an attribute of
the data but of the view of the data. It is available via the 
:BIN-COUNTS method. ( I've complained in the past that Xlisp-Stat's
plot objects don't make the distinction between data and views 
clear enough sometimes, but it looks like Luke was trying to maintain
some distinction here. It may have been a sacrifice to performance
that required the data slots to be internal to graphics objects. ) 


Re: your other question about :SLOT-NAMES :

I'm not sure what your question is, however... 

If the problem is that the list is too long, sometimes you may
want to try :OWN-SLOTS on the prototype object. :SLOT-NAMES 
returns the names of all slots inherited or owned by that object.
:OWN-SLOTS returns only the slots owned by that object. ( note
that you will most likely get a different list returned by 
sending that message to the prototype versus and instance of
that prototype. )

If what you want is different formatting of the output, you can
try pretty-printing the returned list: 

> ( pprint ( send hist :own-slots ))

Or define another function that formats and prints the list 
the way you like it. 


If the problem is finding the appropriate method or slot when
you're not sure what it's called, you can try something like
this -- an :apropos method for objects that's a sort of parallel
to the apropos function:


( defmeth *object* :apropos ( str &key help )
  ( dolist 
    ( name ( send self :doc-topics ))
    ( when (string-search  str (symbol-name name)) 
           ( if help 
                ( progn ( send self :help name ) (terpri))
                (format t "~s~%" name ))))
  ( format t "~a : ~a SLOTS:~%" ( slot-value 'proto-name ) self )
  ( dolist 
    ( name ( send self :slot-names ))
    ( when (string-search str (symbol-name name))
           ( format t "~s : ~a~%" name ( slot-value name )))))

To give the contrary example, one place where the xlisp-stat plot-object
design doesn't work as well is with boxplots. 
 :NUM-POINTS of a boxplot is  zero.
Which is clearly correct of the graphic view, but not of the data points
of the data model. ( If you're going to accuse me of confusing the
two, my point is that the design of Lisp-Stat graphics objects encourages
this confusion somewhat. If you use scatterplots that allow some direct
manipulation, then you are sort of forced to using plot-objects as the
repository of their data. ) 
 
 In my jitterplot code,
<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Sources/jitterpl.lsp>,
 I was trying not just to change the presentation, but to make 
 "smarter" boxplots: there are some methods added to handle grouped
 data. 

( defmeth jitterplot-proto :group-points 
	( gn  &optional msg (value nil set))
 "Args: ( group-number &optional msg value ) 
   - with group-number as sole argument, returns the point-numbers 
	for  data-group.
   - with msg, sends msg using point-numbers as an arg. 
	( msg may be a single keyword or a list of arguments ). 
	Provide value arg for setter form of message. 
 example: 
      ( send boxplot :group-points 2 '( :point-coordinates 1 )) 
          -- returns the y values of group #2 
      ( send boxplot :group-points 1 :point-color 'blue )
             -- sets the points in group #1 to blue." 

... 


However, these additions also fall short of a real and consistent
Model-View type model: the boxplot overlays, for example, do not
automatically respond to changes in the point data. 
( Some of the inconsistency is due to trying to follow & integrate 
  with standard lisp-stat graphics objects, and some is due to 
  my own lack of consistency in my first stab at this problem. )

Xlisp-Stat is missing from this comparison. 

It consists of a series of tables of support for various types of
math function, graphics, foreign function, etc. 

Maybe if someone can contribute the table entries for XlispStat, 
we could convince the author to include it.

Dear users of S-Plus,

I would like to announce my testreport "Comparison of mathematical
programs for data analysis" which has just been finished. The testreport
which is written in English is available at the following website :

	http://www.uni-frankfurt.de/~stst/ncrunch.html

This testreport contains information about the actual versions of the
programs

- GAUSS       (Version 3.2)
- Macsyma     (Version 2.2)
- Maple       (Version 4.0)
- Mathematica (Version 3.0)
- Matlab      (Version 5.1)
- MuPAD       (Version 1.3)
- O-Matrix    (Version 3.2)
- Ox          (Version 1.11)
- S-Plus      (Version 4.0)

grouped by the following sections

- Comparison of the mathematical functionality 
- Comparison of the graphical functionality 
- Functionality of the programming environment 
- Data import/export options 
- Available operating systems 
- Speed comparison 
- Summary

The weighting for the above listed sections are all explained in the
testreport so that an individuel weighting could also be done.

Sincerely,



Stefan Steinhaus

P.S. Please feel free to email me your impressions and critism about it.

I have typed up a table containing all of the stat system features covered
by the testreport.

The features are the rows of the table.

I have included my (initial) rating of LispStat using the testreport's
rating categories of "+", "-", or "m".
 "+" means the feature is supported
 "-" means not supported
 "m" means it is available in an additional module (i.e., in code not
included in the original distribution of LispStat, but available from the
net).

I've added "?" in places I'm not sure about my rating.

I've added a few random comments.

I'd appreciate anyone else's additions/corrections, especially about
whether "-"s should be "m"s. Then I'll send it to Stefan Steinhaus.

This message will probably only be of interest to Debian GNU/Linux
users who also use xlispstat.

I hope to prepare several packages of statistical software, including
xlispstat, ViSta, R and ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistics), for the Debian
distribution of Linux.  The xlispstat package is the simplest of
these.  I have created a preliminary version of the package and made
it available as
    ftp://franz.stat.wisc.edu/pub/Debian/xlispstat_3.50-1_i386.deb
There is also a .rpm file for RedHat systems in that directory.  The
.rpm file was created from the .deb file using the "alien" program on
Debian so it may look a little strange to RedHat users.  I don't
know.  I don't use RedHat myself.

If you are a Debian user, I would appreciate it if you could try to
install the package and report back to me on any problems that you
encounter.  This is the first time that I have created a Debian
package and I trust that there are several gliches for me to repair.

If you have read this far and do not know what "Debian" is, check out
			http://www.debian.org/
Debian is a Linux distribution, i.e. a way of installing Linux on your
computer. Generally people who try several different distributions end
up preferring the Debian or the RedHat distribution.  Both Debian and
RedHat have powerful management systems for installing, removing and
upgrading applications software and even system software.  Those in
the Debian camp believe that the Debian tools are superior.

I am new to xlispstat (at least in terms of trying
to become a regular user), and I must be
missing something basic about creating simple line plots
with labels.  What I would like is to create plots
with 1, 2 or a few variables plotted vs time on the x axes, with a 
"legend" of sorts that indicates what each line corresponds to.
From a quick read of the book, I thought 
that sending a :variable-label message is how to do it,
but I tried:

> (setf tList '( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ))
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)
> (setf pList '( 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 ))
(2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20)
> (setf s (plot-points tList pList))
#<Object: 1074335064, prototype = SCATTERPLOT-PROTO>
> (send s :showing-labels t)
T
> (send s :variable-label 0 "fitness")
"fitness"
> 

and although the line plot appears (with one line in this case),
no variable label ("fitness") appears.

Can anyone please tell me what I am not doing that I should be,
or how I should be doing this differently?

I also would like to put a title in the graph (not on the window),
and text labels on the axes (in addition to the numeric labels 
for the tick marks that one gets for free with the plot-points 
function).   One way I got a title in the plot was with an overlay 
(similar to the description on pp286+).
That worked fine for the title (e.g., it redraws and resizes correctly), 
and I can see how I could do the same for axes labels, but I wondered if 
a) there is an easier way to do it
   (eg some methods I am not aware of), or
b) there there are libraries of user supplied codes
   out there that provide this kind of functionality?

Thanks for any help and pointers you can provide.

See: 
> ( send p :help :y-axis )
Y-AXIS
Method args: (&optional showing labeled ticks)
Sets or retrieves current acis label state. SHOWING and LABELED should be
true or NIL; TICKS should be a number. All three should be supplied for
setting
a new state. A list of the three properties is returned.

-- the same for :x-axis. 
You need to set the second arg:

( let  (( xa ( send s :x-axis ))
	( ya ( send s :y-axis )))
	( send s :x-axis ( first xa ) T ( third xa ))
	( send s :y-axis ( first ya ) T ( third ya )))


The variable labels will then appear next to the axis.

I have a bunch of graphics classes in:
  <http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Sources/>
and partially documented and annotated in:
  <http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Docs/SourceIndex.html>

which add some extensions to scatterplot objects and overlay objects. 
I don't know if any of them will do exactly what you want, but it
might be a source to learn some of the not-as-well documented graphics
tricks. 

  I do have a text overlay class that uses real coordinates for it's
 placement -- this was meant so that I could automatically label 
 spectral peaks in a line graph -- using a point label wouldn't 
 work without a point, although I suppose I could have put in a 
 "phantom" point to attach the label to. ( This is in realgraf.lsp )

 You might also look at backgrid.lsp, which handles background grid
 lines. Not what you're asking for, but the code uses some axis 
 attributes to figure out where to draw the lines, and it adds some 
 methods and attributes to scatterplots to do this if GRID-COLOR is
 set. i.e. it might be a good example to look at if you want to do
 custom axes.

although the text labels use real graph coordinates for placement, 
there is a magic interpretation of #.positive-infinity and 
#.negative-infinity as up-against-the-(top,right,bottom,left) edge
of the window. So if you want to label features that are at some
set of real x coordinates in the graph, but want the labels out 
of the way in the upper edge of the window, use :

(send plot :add-overlay 
   (label text real-x  #.positive-infinity :color 'red :just :below))


[ I'm not sure that the use of just keywords makes obvious sense -- 
  I had to try it myself just now to see what works -- a sign that
  it's not obvious what it's in reference to. I'll have to change
  this and document it better! ]

While giving it a test, I found one bug in those label classes
which may be related to MacOS 8 -- I don't have a 7.x machine
nearby to test if this bug was in the old version and I just missed
it, or if it's new behaviour: Running XlispStat under MacOS 8, 
on graphics windows, even without scrollbars, there is a region of the
window where the scroll bars would be, on the right hand side, with no
content. ( The same thing doesn't happen on the bottom for some reason.)

labels placed with an X coordinate of #.positive-infinity, will be
justified against the right edge of the window, and will be obscured
by this content free region. The placement code should be modified 
to subtract some small value for this scroll area. ( I'll fix that

Is there a way to get the unix process number of
the running xlispstat into an list variable in that process?
(For example, perl has a special variable with that value.)

Or more generally is there a way to capture the stdout
stream from a job started with 
  (system <command>)
For example, capture each line as the value of a 
entry in a list of strings, one string for each output line.
That would open up a lot of possibilites.
thanks.

An undocumented feature of the current system command is that it takes
a stream to use as output for its second argument.  So or example,

> (with-output-to-string (s) (system "date" s))
"Mon Sep 15 10:15:54 CDT 1997
"

The feature is undocumented because it may change once I figure out a
better way to do it, so rely on this with caution.

Hello,

I open a file with this command :

(set f1 (open "myfile" :direction :output))

I would like to write at the end of the file and no to overwritten.
How can I do ?  (I'm a beginner in xlispstat)

Thanks in advance and have a nice day.

For example:
  (with-open-file (of "myfile" :direction :output
		      :if-does-not-exist :create
		      :if-exists :append)
OPEN has the same keyword arguments than with-open-file.

   hi

   Does anyone know, how to implement a call to a native c function from 
   xlisp-stat?

   psksvp@ccs.neu.edu

The functions you need are "dyn-load" and "call-cfun".  There is some
on-line documentation of these.  Also you can look in the xlispstat
book.  The way to compile c code for dynamic loading varies between
platforms -- consult the machine-dependent documentation in the
xlispstat source distribution for details.

Hi.  In addition to the book and the on-line help, here are some extra notes
that clarify a couple of points that aren't mentioned in the book.  These are
just notes I wrote for our system here - I don't know how universally they
apply.  I assume a UNIX setup with GNU's gcc compiler.  Hope they help a little.

Any corrections to this material welcome!

Notes on Binding C Functions into Xlisp-stat
--------------------------------------------

Bear in mind that Xlisp-stat only offers dynamic loading of C functions,
not static loading.  Then:

1.  If you recompile your object files, you must quit Xlisp-stat and re-enter
it before loading them again. (dyn-load "myfunction.o") will _not_ overload
the routine with the new version.

2.  Although Luke Tierney's book points out that you can load libraries such
as -lm for the maths library etc, I haven't been able to work that with
libraries I've written myself.  If that's right and not just my error, then
if your c code needs external functions, you cannot make a library and then
use the :libflags option.  You must make a .so file instead, as follows:

ld -dy -G myfunction.o mylibrary.lib -lm -o myfunction.so

(You probably could leave the -lm for the :libflags option to cope
with, but you can't do that with "mylibrary.lib".)

The -dy option specifies dynamic instead of static code.  -G specifies a
shared object.  

You can then use (dyn-load "myfunction.so") and (call-cfun "myfunction" arg1
arg2 etc) as described in the manual.

3.  You _do_ have to take note of argument types - unusually for Xlisp-stat. 
For example, you could write code where all the arguments are doubles,
and forcing Xlisp-stat to represent your data as floats e.g. by writing 1.0
instead of 1.

Also note that the proper incantation for creating shared objects can vary

Hi

Thanks for all your answers, but I am using xlisp-stat on a pc running NT4. 
I don't seem to find any infos about this topic in the source distribution.
Have any of you, aven done this on pc version of xlisp-stat?

thanks in advance

Hello, all.  May I ask: does Lisp-stat let us control the tick marks on a
scatterplot?  My x data runs from 1-9.  For visual reasons I don't want the
x-axis going through the point x=1, for example, so I'm using

:range 0 0 10

to give some extra room at each side: but that causes tick marks to appear
for 0 and 10, which are entirely meaningless co-ordinates for this data.
Is there some way I can stretch the range while leaving the outer tick marks
at 1 and 9?

Many thanks,

Richard Stevens

The Debian distribution of the Linux operating system (see

packages available in the "math" section of the distribution.  At
present this package is only available for the "unstable" distribution
which is the development version of Debian 2.0.  I will also try to
provide the package for the "stable" (Debian 1.3.1) version.

It's not as easy as it *ought* to be, but it's not TOO difficult. 


The routine that draw the axis and tickmarks is part of the Iview 
graphics package -- i.e. the part written in C underneath XlispStat.
The :x-axis & :y-axis scatterplot methods just set parameters that
are used by this code. 

There is no lisp visible :redraw-axes method you could override to 
change the behavious, however, you can back up a bit and redefine
:redraw-background. The default method is also implemented in C,
but if you redefine that method, it will be called instead. 


 I redefine :redraw-background in 
<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Sources/backgrid.lsp>
so that I can draw colored grid lines -- palegreen :grid-color
and mintcream :back-color makes a nice graph-paper effect -- 
but I still want the default axes draw, so it does a 
(call-next-method) so that the default :redraw-background is 
also called. 


The default method in C:

VOID IViewStdRedrawBackground P1C(IVIEW_WINDOW, w)
{
  int left, top, height, width;
  StGWWinInfo *gwinfo = IViewWindowWinInfo(w);
  
  StGWStartBuffering(gwinfo);
  
  if (IViewMouseMode(w) == brushing) IViewEraseBrush(w);
  StGWGetViewRect(gwinfo, &left, &top, &width, &height);  
  StGWSetClipRect(gwinfo, TRUE, left, top, width, height);
  StGWEraseRect(gwinfo, left, top, width, height);
  IViewDrawAxes(w);
  StGWBufferToScreen(gwinfo, left, top, width, height);
  if (IViewMouseMode(w) == brushing) IViewDrawBrush(w);
}


If you skip the MouseMode part for now, basically clears
the window and sets it to the background color ( which
you can do from lisp by calling the windows :erase-window
method ) and draws the axes. 

If you look at my backgrid.lsp code, it replicates some of
the logic of the axes drawing routine. It gets the same 
axes parameters to draw the extended grid lines at the same
points as the tic marks on the graph. If you change the
graph axes parameters ( or if something else changes it 
automatically ) the grid lines will follow the tics. 

 You could start from that code and modify it to:
[1] allow setting of a different initial offset or setting 
    of a list of tic coordinates;
[2] draw tiny ticks instead of long grid lines.
[3] take the (call-next-method) out of :redraw-background and
  insert :erase-window and a call to your axes method.

I've recently had to interface what's been basically the same shared
library (growing and changing over time) on the Mac, first to XlispStat,
then to NIH Image, and now to Python. I'm doing the Python mostly 
because the XlispStat dll has a pretty "thin" interface -- it's not
easy to code to a complex foreign function interface. 

A couple of observations and questions:

 It ought to be possible to export the wrapper functions to convert
C data types to/from Lisp objects. i.e. build much of XlispStat as
a core shared library, which the XlispStat application and other
dynamic/shared library code can all link to. ( This is what Python
does ). Shared library code could then use that XLisp API for wrapping
and unwrapping args.  

 Is this collection of wrapper functions documented anywhere ? 
Is there any info on how to add an new hardware-object written in
C to the object system ? 


 I have been learning how to use SWIG -- Simple Wrapper and Interface
Generator <http://www.cs.utah.edu/~beazley/SWIG/swig.html> to 
generate the "glue code" to make my functions Python callable. 
This is a very nice tool -- it takes an interface description 
file, or sometimes it can simply take an .h file, and it generates
all of the necessary glue code to make the functions callable from
Python, Perl, tcl, or guile. It is possible to add new language
interfaces and extensions. (But I haven't gotten so far as to know
how difficult this is.) Has anyone familiar with the XlispStat 
internals looked at this tool ?

It would be great to have XlispStat in library form (similar to
libtcl or libphp or libsiod or libguile). 
I think the slisp project at the University 
of Washington (http://betz.biostr.washington.edu/slisp/) did do
something similar for Xlisp. This would make it possible, for
instance, to have an XlispStat Apache module, and maybe an NSAPI
XlispStat plugin, with not too much work. Also calling XlispStat
from Java etc would be easier. And we can have embedded Xlisp
interpreters in our C programs. 

With the new department and all, I have absolutely zero time to
work on this, but I'll try to get some grad students interested.

Also, what is the status of replacing code resources on the Mac
with shared libraries. Is there a version for 3.50 ?

I'm not sure if my previous message about a Debian GNU/Linux package
for xlispstat-3.50 made it to the entire list.  I got an unusual
message about it bouncing.  In case it didn't make it, here is a synopsis.

xlispstat is now an official part of the Debian distribution of Linux.
See http://www.debian.org/ for more information on Debian Linux.

The xlispstat-3.50 package is in the math subsection of the "unstable"
(a.k.a. "hamm") distribution.  This is the development version for
Debian 2.0.  If you are running Debian 1.3 (a.k.a. "stable" or "bo")
you can pick up a copy from
	       ftp://franz.stat.wisc.edu/pub/Debian/bo

A .rpm package for RedHat Linux (possibly also suitable for Caldera or
SuSE, I don't know) is in the directory
		 ftp://franz.stat.wisc.edu/pub/Debian

I would appreciate feedback on successes (or otherwise) in the
installation process.

P.S. If you are wondering about the names "hamm" and "bo", the code
names for various releases of Debian are names of characters from the
movie "Toy Story".  Bruce Perens, the director of the Debian project,
works for Pixar.

I'm routinely using a version of 3.50 built with Bob Stine's 
patch for supporting shared libraries. However, since that
code completely changes the function of #'open-resource-file,
it is not compatible with code that might actually need to use
something from a resource file, such as a cursor bitmap. 

It really needs to be renamed to keep both functions separate
before it's a candidate for incorporating into the standard 
distribution. ( Something I was considering doing, however 
all of these other problems and concerns led me to stop and 
think about whether there is a better way. Besides SWIG, I've
been experimenting a tiny bit with COM on the Mac -- which now
gets installed on your Mac with MS Internet Explorer's Active-X
support. ) 

It obviously ought to be a portable interface -- even if the 
implementation is different. 

What function handles loading shared libraries on the other platforms ?

Another thing to consider might be the triple The Gimp/Net-Fu/Script-Fu.
The GIMP is an image generating machine (a bit Photoshop like), 
Script-Fu is a scripting language to drive it (actually Scheme
from the SIOD library, but there are versions in Python and Guile as well),
and Net-Fu is a Java interface that replaces Script-Fu over the net.
See http://www.XCF.Berkeley.EDU/~gimp/.

True... they are from the paper and pencil days, and are probably easier to
do that way then in Lisp!

But... they are popular in intro psych (and other social sciences) stat
courses, and I feel as though I need one to have a complete system. I'm
glad Jan has one and I don't have to write it.

Perhaps there is a way a computerized stem and leaf can be "featurized" to
take advantage of the computer and provide more than just paper and pencil.

Hello,

I want sort a list with numbers and strings.  But the sort-data function
doesn't work with numbers and strings in the single list.

For example :

> (def toto ( list 5 "g" 1 7 "a"))
> (sort-data toto)
Error: can't compare these
Happened in: #<Subr-SORT-DATA: #8101f50>

How can I do this ?

Thanks in advance.

Isabelle

PS : I am a beginner in xlispstat.

 The first question is what do you expect the results of sorting
( list 5 "g" 1 7 "a" ) to be ?  all the strings sorted followed
by all the ints ? or the other way around ? or strings falling 
in between ints according to the ordinal value of their ascii
codes ?  Which is greater, 5 or "g" ? 
 

 The procedure #'sort takes a list and a predicate. 
#'sort-data is a simpler packaging of:
	( sort number-seq #'< )   	#for numbers and 
	( sort string-seq #'string< )   #for strings 


 If you know what you want the sorted order of ( list 5 "g" 1 7 "a" )
to be, you can define a predicate that will allow it to be sorted,
but there is no defined ordering of that list. 

( Python, for another example, does allow sorting of mixed type lists 
  by default, but it's defined as an arbitrary sorting of types, with
  each item of type sorted among itself. No really very meaningful, but
  it can still be useful to have a defined order. )

Going by memory ( There may be some messages I wrote at the time in the
archive. ):

I've compiled XlispStat 3.50  for PPC under CWPRO1. 

[1] You may need to change the libraries and access paths -- I don't 
remember if it shipped with the MSL libraries set in the project. 
If you do, there is a file in the release notes folder that tells
you what new libraries replace what old libraries. 


[2] The MSL libraries removed EACCESS, so I put that back in CWHeader.h:

#define EACCES					38
/* removed from MSL <errno.h> * added here for back compatibility */


[3] I had to change the default settings for precompiled headers 
in MacHeaders.c ( in the MW Code Warrior:MacOS Support:MacHeaders folder.)

These are what I have them set to currently. I think that is correct,
but it's possible I changed them again for some other project. 

#define		OLDROUTINENAMES 	1
#define 	OLDROUTINELOCATIONS 	0


I did not try compiling for 68K, but I would expect the same changed
to work for that project. If it still doesn't work, let me know what
error you're getting. 


( My mention of CFM libraries didn't have anything to do with getting 
 it to link succseefully -- it was dynamic loading of CFM libraries 
 of external routines. Try to get the vanilla distribution to build 
 before you try adding any patches. )

Hi,

I have a method, in a quite big project, that work fine in XLS version 
XLISP-STAT 2.1 Release 3.44 (Beta).

and it works fine too in 
release 3.50 installed in a Sun Ultra-sparc-1.
But when I compile it in this last environment, it fails,
it gives me an error I can't trace back because it is compiled code.

Any suggestion?

===========================


(defmeth wkde-proto :do-mode-testing-click (x y m1 m2)
"when click, identify the mode, draw coordinates and lines
 and mark the 'show-modes with the index of the mode
 then call the :test-a-mode kde-proto method"
  (kde-require "modetest" "modetest")
  (let* ((rect (send self :content-rect))
         (xyscaled (send self :canvas-to-scaled x y))
         finalxy
         (xclic (first xyscaled))
         modl index finalindex curr (diff 9e999))
   (when (and (< (first rect) x (+ (first rect) (third rect)))

Hi folks:

I have exactly the same problem with ViSta, which is why I continue to use
3.44 as well.

Give me an example that is as simple as you can make it but complete
enough so I can reproduce the problem and I'll look into it.

You're missing the MSL Runtime Lib.

And you may need to add console.stubs.c

And I needed that.

So, it all compiles. Now I think, I am all set to go back to trying to
build expert horse-player systems with belief networks.

I check out my XLS68K881

This blows me out of the water. Then I remember seeing a note from Luke
last spring about some library problems with the self-same version I'm
trying to compile.

After noticing that there is still no 68K 881 version, my curiosity piques
wondering if there is no 881 version becuase of the wrong library, the
non-existence of the right library, or something else.

Please note I will happily pursue this problem, as I believe in getting 10
years of use out of every computer and my Quadra 660av has another 5 to go.

Well Luke, thinks are not so easy. Trying to locate the problem I found 
first that using 3.50 under win95 gives me no problem. Compiled or not, 
my method works fine.

Then I moved again to Solaris 5.2 and the problem was still there. I got
the error:

> 
Error: bad argument type - INFINITY
Break level 1.

when running the compiled code. Not with the interpreted one.

Then, this INFINITY made me suspicious... I had a declaration like
     (setf diff 9e999)
to make diff act as a flag. I wanted diff start with a bigggg value and I 
typed 9e999. It looks like the interpreter works fine with Infinity but 
compiled code fails.

The function

(defun big ()
  (setf diff 9e999)
  (when (< 33 diff)
	(print 33))
  diff)

works fine but when compiled fails. OK, I don't need anything as 
big as 9e999, so by now some of my problems are solved.

The way Metrowerks does their 68K libraries there are either 8 or 16
-- I forget -- different libraries you need to choose from depending
on flags in your project. They don't give you all combinations but do
give you an apple script to build what it missing. Unfortunately
getting the flags right in that build is tricky, at least for me, and
if you don't the code blows up. I think I have this working in CW Pro,
but I am tired of going through it every time they come out with a new
release, so I will probably try to streamline the 68K distribution.
Since the 881 version seems to be used very little these days, and
there aren't a whole lot of non 020 or better machines left, I'll
probably switch to just the 020 distribution for 68K machines.

I've written some software which draws lines, circles, circular arcs etc, 
on a prototype derived from graph-window-proto (NOT graph-proto). Does 
anyone have a "magic" method for production of nice PostScript for such 
drawings? Really, it is just the sort of thing PostScript is good at, so 
it ought to be possible. I'm most interested in a Unix solution, but any 
solution which gives me better than a PostScript bitmap is of interest.

Just in case anyone is interested, the software is called BAYES-LIN, and
is really for local computation in Bayes linear belief networks, via
message-passing between objects representing clique-tree nodes. You can
download it, and its (sparse) documentation from: 
		http://www.ncl.ac.uk/~ndjw1/bayeslin/
I would like to be able to get nice PostScript output of the diagnostic 
plots it produces.

Cheers,

Has anyone written a more-or-less general tool for
creating gray-scaled (or other colorscale) densitiy plots
for 2D data?  That is, what I'd like to send it is
a list of lists representing a 2D matrix of density values
and then have it put up a graph window with with
little rectangles, one for each entry in the matrix,
with its darkness (color) representing the value of the
corresonding cell in the matrix.
(other features, eg normalization control, etc, would be
nice but I'd settle for any starting code.)

thanks!

I'm embarrassed to admit that I think I asked this question before,

Given a factor x, and a response y, how does one sort x by y.  That is,
I sort x, but want to keep the original y value with the corresponding
x value.

Thanks as always!

Lisp #'sort ( as opposed to xlisp-stat sort-data ) takes a predicate 
that is the function used to order the list. Thus, if you have a list
of lists of ( x y ) pairs:

[1]: ( sort pair-list #'( lambda (a b) (< (second a) (second b))) )

Will sort a list of pairs by the second (cadr) element. 



Common Lisp #'sort also takes a :key argument, and although 
( help 'sort ) does not indicate a :key argument, the following
does in fact work correctly:  ( shorter and equivalent to #[1] )

[2]: ( sort pair-list #'< :key #'cadr ) 



But you're right -- you did ask this question ( in a slightly 
different form) once before, and ...

Most of the tests in xlisp-stat are vectorized -- when applied
to a list you get a list of (T|NIL)'s. #'WHICH will return the
indices for which the element is non-nil:

( defun indices ( list pred )
  ( which ( map 'cons  pred list )))


whould give you a single function that does what you want (I think).

Subject: hide windows until positioned, sized, etc...

I would like to know if its possible to
hide an entire window, eg, a window
created by a plot-points or a histogram function call,
until I get done resizing it, positioning it, etc.

For example, I might do:

   (setf aPlot (plot-points xlocs ylocs))
   (send aPlot :range 0 -1 17)  
   (send aPlot :range 1 -1 17)
   (send aPlot :title title)
   (send aPlot :location 0 20)

and so on.  

I also go on to set symbols for subsets of the points, etc.
I have kludged things (via start-buffering, etc)
so that the content doesn't show until all the points
are added and symbols assigned.

But I can't figure out how to just hide the entire
window until everything is done and ready to see in its
final state and place and size, so the user 
doesn't have to see the window jump around, resize, etc.

Thanks for any help.

You can add ":SHOW NIL" to either the :ISNEW call for a 
graph-window ( including scatterplot-proto ) or to the
#'PLOT-POINTS function. 

	(setf aPlot (plot-points xlocs ylocs :show nil))
	...
	(send aPlot :show-window)

You might look at a previous thread: "How to draw 3-d plot of RGB space".
  There's also a  piece of code at:
<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Sources/rgbspace.lsp>
   but the comments and discussion were all in that thread. 
This code was a 3-d plot of the colors in RGB.TXT in rgb-color space. 


For your use, you need to decide on a linear color mapping. 
( IMHO: lots of gray levels are hard to distinguish. 
 <http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Sources/colorspaces.lsp>
  has rgb<>hsv functions that might help in generating a better
  pseudo color scheme. ) 

Then you have to add the colors in the scheme to the color table. 

Before you generate the colors, you need to know how many colors 
you can have in the color table. I did this ( the example was in
that previous thread ) by adding colors until add-color failed 
when the table was full. This is a little awkward, since you need
to know how many colors you can have to evenly space the color
mapping. ( Maybe iview should export this value to xlispstat ?  ) 
If you know what that value is, you can make it a constant for a 
temporary, non-portable hack. 

Sort the table of color symbols by your mapping scheme. 

Scale the values and map them into (iseq num-colors). 

Use those values as indexes into your sorted color-table,
and  send graph :point-color. 

You might want to select all of the points ( which is what I do
in the rgbspace code ) and maybe set the point-symbol. ( Unselected
points are "hollow" and don't show the colors as well as selected
solid point symbols. )

Steve,
Thanks for the pointers.

One question:  
Your comment seems to imply there is an online source
for old stat-lisp-news items.  
I didn't know that.  Where might that be?
thanks!

Well -- I thought there was an archive. There's an archive file at:

<ftp://ftp.stat.umn.edu/pub/xlispstat/other/stat-lisp-news/archive>

However, the README file says that it's updated irregularly by hand,
and my browser shows the files data as 11/25/96 !

( It looks like the same files, but gziped, on the ucla mirror. ) 

Sorry. Is there any more up-to-date archive ? 

( If not, I'll see if I can sort out my own personal archive files
  and put them somewhere on my web. )

I'll announce this now, before I get too far along. 
(especially in case anyone else has started on this or was
about to start. )  

Comments ? 


[1] Right now I'm in the midst of reorganizing the Mac xlisp-stat CW
projects:

 Updating to CW-PRO1 / IDE-2 & updating libraries and paths.
 changing to a single project file with multiple targets.
 adding library projects for PPC and 68K 
  ( most sources, minus xlisp.c, console.stubs.c and libraries )
 changing 68K and PPC application targets to use libraries. 
  ( eventually shared libraries ) 


[ The above, except for shared libraries is done. 
  Other targets should be added for CFM68K, vanilla 68K, etc. ] 


[2] Next phase: 
Change Bob Stine's dynamic loading / shared library code ( which 
I have been happily (and essentially) using for some time now. ): 

  change the names of the functions so that they don't replace 
  Open/CloseResourceFile, which also have other functions on the
  mac. ( Load/Free_DLL are the windows names, I think. ) 

  Put original Open/Close resource code back in. 

  Add #'CALL_LFUN code to mac projects to call functions that use XLISP
API. 


[3] Putting one and two together -- we'll be able to build dynamically
loadable shared lib code that uses Xlisp calling conventions and uses 
the Xlisp APIs to  get and return args and to handle symbols, lisp
sequences, call-backs, etc. 



I'm going to be doing minimal work on the 68K and CFM-68K part -- all
of the essential lab machines here have been upgraded to PPC. I have 
a 68K lib and a 68K881 target that appear to work. But if anyone else
is willing to build and test some of the other flavors, I'll be happy
to integrate these into this new project. 


I'm going to keep OpenResourceFile because it's needed for some other
functions, like getting cursors or other non-code mac resources. I'm
not real concerned with keeping both CFM and non-CFM dyn-load in the
same image, but I will try to keep which syle of dynload as a compile
time option.
